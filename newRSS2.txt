Yogi Berra was great and sweet, a bent, short, famous old guy with a gap-toothed smile. Raising an arm again to our cheering while he made his way to the plate or the mound for another pregame ceremonial moment, with Whitey and Moose and Phil and the rest awaiting him, he tapped the syrupy strain of affection that tastes also of Elvis and Goofy and Chekhov. When we sat down again, somebody in the next seat would be saying, “When you get to a fork in the road, take it,” or “It gets late early out there,” or some other Yogi-ism that would keep the candied moment going. Berra, who died yesterday, played for the Yankees for eighteen seasons and the Mets for one, compiling a .285 batting average, with three hundred and fifty-eight home runs and fourteen hundred and thirty runs batted in. His postseason marks were equally impressive—seventy-one hits, thirty-nine R.B.I.s, and twelve homers—but even these figures feel legendary in sum and slightly distance us from the kind of player and man he was. There is a hovering temptation, for instance, to dismiss his World Series figures a little, because they depend so much on the Yankees’ repeated presence in the classic. But this is patronizing and unfair. Given his chances, Yogi hit them out of sight. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/sports/baseball/yogi-berra-dies-at-90-yankees-baseball-catcher.html?_r=0" target="_blank">The <em>Times</em>’s splendid obituary</a>, by Bruce Weber, does the right thing. It carefully compares Berra’s over-all lifetime stats as a catcher to those of a prior Hall of Fame Yankees catcher, Bill Dickey, and shows, I think, that Yogi was the better backstop. It also brings in Johnny Bench, and clarifies our thinking about the best catcher ever.</p> <p>I can almost bring Yogi back in memory, up at the plate, powerfully round and thick and bearish in his work-smudged pinstripes, with his head (in a cap, not a helmet) tipped a little, as if to give him more height while he stares out at the pitcher. The pitch is up, out of the strike zone, but Berra slashes at it anyway—it’s up by his eyes, because the force of his swing has dropped him down—and he drives it distantly. He runs hard, startling you again with his speed and strength, and rounds first base at full speed, leaning sideways like a racing car, then pulls up in a shower of dirt and scrambles back to the bag. I’m on my feet, yelling and laughing with everyone else. Yogi, Yogi—there’s no one else like him. The laughter isn’t sweet; it’s all wonder.</p> <p>I think of him behind the plate as well: a thinking bookend, a stump in charge. When he straightens up and steps forward, pointing to an infielder or giving his pitcher an extra breath or two, his pads and mask make him even stubbier. His return flips to the mounded pitcher and his powerful pegs to second against a base-stealer always have a little uphill tilt.</p> <p>I remember Yogi on an April morning in 1946, when he played center field for the Yanks in their first home opener after the war. (He’d been in the Navy and won a Purple Heart for his service in Europe, and he had got back the summer before to play his first few games as a major leaguer.) Back from my war, too, I was in the stands that day and, like everyone else there, exulted in the idea of years’ more baseball to come. I can’t recall who won, but believe that Yogi had a rough time of it out there, even falling down once. The Yankees would figure out the right place for him in time; you could see that.</p> <p>The Yanks played in eight World Series between 1949 and 1957, facing the Brooklyn Dodgers five times and the New York Giants twice in that span: fifteen home-town teams for us, a regular thing. This divided but glorious possessiveness is hard to imagine, a time of baseball by radio, with the late news spilling out of bars and taxis as you walked by, and names—Peewee, Willy, Eddie, Allie, Mickey, Sandy, Yogi—that you heard almost more often than those of folks in the family. Games and pitches and at-bats dim and disappear, replaced by photographs and ever-available televised clichés: Yogi nose to nose with the umpire Bill Summers after Jackie Robinson has stolen home, skidding under his tag in the 1955 World Series; Yogi jumping into Allie Reynolds’s arms after he dropped Ted Williams’s foul fly ball, then caught the next one, almost in the exact same spot, to save Reynolds’s no-hitter. He ran out for another leaping hug-up after Don Larsen’s World Series perfecto, in 1956, this time adding a leg wrap.</p> <p>Berra retired as a player in 1963 but became the Yankees’ manager in 1964, acquiring a sudden seriousness that we weren’t prepared for. (The Yankees went 99–63.) He was fired after losing the World Series that year to the Cardinals, whose manager, Johnny Keane, weirdly also lost his job. Then, in another Bronxian twist, Keane was named as Yogi’s replacement. Berra went over to the Mets as a coach and became their manager from 1972 to 1975. Back at the Yankee helm in 1984, he got to manage one of his sons, Dale Berra, an infielder. In the late summer of 1985, he got canned, in spite of a guarantee of a three-year tenure, another victim of the owner’s overbearing impatience. Berra did not set foot in Yankee Stadium for the next fourteen years, despite many Georgian pleadings, supplying character and silence where both were in short supply. He opened a museum near his home, in Montclair, and went on with his long, happy marriage to Carmen. (She died in 2014.) We smiled and missed him, and made him into a funny saint.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>For decades, any mention of his name made you smile.

Apart from the fact that it bore the license plate SCV 1, denoting it as the first vehicle of the Vatican City (“<em>Status Civitatis Vaticanae</em>”), it looked like any other 500L—a 1.4-liter, somewhat elongated version of the iconic Fiat 500, which gets about thirty-five miles to the gallon and costs around twenty thousand dollars. A Marine sentry held open the rear door on the passenger side, and the seventy-eight-year-old Pope climbed out to greet the President. He’d been in the United States, which accounts for about a fifth of the world’s total oil consumption, for only about eighteen hours, and up to that point hadn’t said a word in public. Already, however, he had delivered a message.</p> <p>That’s how this Pope often operates—through symbolism and gestures that convey his intentions&nbsp;in ways that words never could. As the theological leader of the faithful, his primary job is to define and redefine Catholic teaching for the twenty-first century, which, like his predecessors, he does partly by issuing written exhortations and encyclicals. In November, 2013, just more than eight months after succeeding Pope Benedict XVI, he issued&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html">two-hundred-and-twenty-page challenge</a>&nbsp;to global capitalism, wherein he said, “Just as the commandment ‘Thou shalt not kill’ sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say ‘thou shalt not’ to an economy of exclusion and inequality.” (Rush Limbaugh dismissed the document as “pure Marxism.”) In June of this year, the Pope released&nbsp;a lengthy&nbsp;<a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">encyclical on climate change</a>,&nbsp;parts of which read as if they had been written by Al Gore and the editors of&nbsp;<em>The Nation</em>. “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,” the encyclical said. It criticized our throwaway consumer culture, called for the world to undergo an “ecological conversion,” and demanded binding steps to limit carbon emissions, as well as global efforts to save the oceans and other threatened natural environments.</p> <p>For good reason, these tracts have drawn a great deal of attention from scholars, commentators, and politicians—some of it supportive, some of it critical. Indeed, Pope Francis’s visit to the United States is all the more fascinating because it is taking place during a Presidential campaign, and much of what he has said on the subject of economics and the environment runs directly counter to the doctrines of the modern Republican Party. On other subjects, however, such as abortion and gay marriage, he has retained teachings that many Democrats finds odious.</p> <p>But that is mere partisan politics. What has lifted Pope Francis above the political fray and reinvigorated his office in a way that could barely have been imagined under Pope Benedict, is his peerless ability to convey to ordinary people of all religions and political views his version of Catholicism—a version based largely on the life and teachings of Saint Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan Order.

A car is necessary to do a lot of work, but, please, choose a more humble one. If you like the fancy one, just think about how many children are dying of hunger in the world.” The same month, he was spotted arriving at a papal summer house in a five-year-old Ford Focus. On previous foreign trips, too, he has largely foregone limousines or specially constructed security vehicles. When he returned to Latin America for the first time since being elevated, he was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323610704578625623748779656">driven around Rio de Janeiro</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;a silver Fiat Idea, a model that is popular with middle-class Brazilians.

Harvey, the twenty-six-year-old ace of the Mets staff, is nearing the end of his first season since coming back from Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, which kept him from pitching in 2014. Earlier this month, Harvey’s agent, Scott Boras, told members of the media that the medically responsible thing for the Mets to do would be to follow a hard innings limit with his client. He claimed that Harvey’s surgeon had set a ceiling of a hundred and eighty innings, after which, Boras argued, the Mets should shut Harvey down for the year.</p> <p>Given that this would, in effect, have meant that Harvey either wouldn’t pitch for the rest of the regular season or wouldn’t pitch in the playoffs (the team is currently sitting first in the N.L. East), Mets executives didn’t exactly embrace this idea. But they haven’t insisted that Harvey shoulder a regular workload, either. Instead, they’ve resolved to use him sparingly down the stretch, limiting him to five or six innings a start. And so, on Sunday night, even though Harvey was pitching well against the Yankees, he came out after only five frames, with the Mets up 1–0 and his season innings total sitting at just under a hundred and seventy-seven. His early departure left the Mets to rely on their shaky bullpen, and the Yankees took full advantage, scoring ten runs in the last four innings.</p> <p>Sunday’s game crystallized, in an almost too-perfect fashion, the dilemma that the Mets are facing: although limiting Harvey’s innings might well be the best strategy for his long-term future, it unquestionably hurts the team’s chances of winning the pennant. (It isn’t just Harvey pitching fewer innings that hurts—the strategy also wears down the Mets’ bullpen.) And even though the Mets are trying to treat Harvey cautiously, their refusal to simply shut him down for the season has been portrayed as a classic case of a company failing to take a “long-term view toward its workers,” as Neil Irwin of the <em>Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/business-lessons-of-matt-harvey-dilemma-go-beyond-mets.html">put it</a>. Michael Baumann, of <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2015-mlb-new-york-mets-matt-harvey-innings-limit/">Grantland</a>, cast it in terms of “moral hazard”: the Mets reap the benefits of Harvey’s pitching, while Harvey alone “bears the physical risk of the arrangement.” In a more just and rational world, the argument goes, the Mets would simply let Harvey sit on the bench for the rest of the season, precisely as Boras said they should (and as the Washington Nationals did with Stephen Strasburg, another Boras client, during their pennant drive in 2012).</p> <p>What’s clearly right in this analysis is that the Mets’ interests and Harvey’s are not the same. But it leaves out one of the fundamental factors shaping the Mets’ decisions: free agency. Harvey is nearing the end of a club-friendly one-year deal in which he’s making just more than six hundred thousand dollars; the Mets hold his rights until the 2018 season, after which he is eligible for unrestricted free agency. Boras wants Harvey to stop pitching this year because this will protect his client’s arm, and therefore protect his chances of signing a huge contract in 2019. But the key point, from New York’s perspective, is that if Harvey does end up pitching well years from now there’s a good chance that it will be for a team willing to pay more for his services in free agency. In other words, the Mets want to maximize their chances of winning a World Series (and making additional playoff revenue) now, while Boras is willing to weaken their prospects in order to increase Harvey’s chances of making more money, playing for what might well be another team, down the road.</p> <p>Some divide between the interests of a team and the interests of its individual players (like the divide between any company and its workers) is inherent in Major League Baseball’s economic system. But the divide between the Mets’ interests and Harvey’s would be much narrower if baseball were still in its pre-free-agency era, when players were essentially forced, unless they were traded, to stay with the same team for their entire careers. Absent free agency, the Mets would know that they’d have Harvey in their rotation for as long as he stayed healthy, which in turn would give them a much greater incentive to protect his long-term well-being—particularly since pitchers of his calibre are incredibly hard to find. In fact, you can see these motives play out in the way that smart organizations, including the Mets, treat pitchers even younger than Harvey, who are still as many as six years away from qualifying for unrestricted free agency. This season, the Mets went for a while with a six-man rotation, instead of the usual five, and they’ve had their other great young pitchers, Jacob de Grom and Noah Syndergaard, skip starts. You’d see even more of this approach if free agency didn’t exist.</p> <p>Obviously, this doesn’t mean that baseball players would be better off without free agency: people should be able to work wherever they want, and be paid by the highest bidder. As it is, their recourse to free agency is restricted by a collective-bargaining agreement that protects the draft system by allowing teams to retain their rights for years afterward. But the paradox of the Harvey situation is that the very mechanism that restores some long-term power to players also encourages teams to churn through them while they’re on the roster. There’s a rough analogy, arguably, to what has happened in corporate America in the past forty years: as lifetime employment has disappeared, and as companies have become far more likely to lay off employees, workers have become more likely to job hop. And, in turn, companies invest much less in worker training and long-term development, because they’re leery of training people who might not stick around. As Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School of Business, has <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204422404576596630897409182">written</a>, employers “rightly point to a significant constraint that they face in training workers: They train them and make the investment, but then someone else offers them more money and hires them away.” This is a problem that companies actually brought on themselves, by undermining the concept of employee loyalty, but the consequence is that workers are generally stewarded less than they once were.</p> <p>In a free-agent world, then, organizations are almost always going to undervalue the long-term development of their workers, and workers are always going to want to optimize their value on the open market. Neither side in the Harvey situation really deserves blame for protecting their interests: The Mets have a player under contract and a reasonable expectation that he will fulfill the terms of that deal, which doesn’t specify an innings limit; Boras wants to maximize Harvey’s chances of staying healthy and getting the payday that he deserves. And as for long-suffering Mets fans? They’ll just hope that, a month from now, everyone is arguing about how many innings Harvey should pitch in the World Series.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>On Sunday night, Mets fans got their first in-person glimpse of the Matt Harvey Dilemma, and the results had to leave them more than a little anxious.

 			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On Sunday night, Mets fans got their first in-person glimpse of the Matt Harvey Dilemma, and the results had to leave them more than a little anxious. Harvey, the twenty-six-year-old ace of the Mets staff, is nearing the end of his first season since coming back from Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, which kept him from pitching in 2014. Earlier this month, Harvey’s agent, Scott Boras, told members of the media that the medically responsible thing for the Mets to do would be to follow a hard innings limit with his client.

On Tuesday, November 4, 2008, nearly a quarter of a million people—young and old, men and women of almost every racial and ethnic background—streamed into Grant Park. The crowd was peaceful and somewhat subdued, filled with a jittery anticipation about how the night would likely unfold. Shortly after 10 <small>P.M.</small> Central Standard Time, television networks announced that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/17/the-joshua-generation">Barack Obama had been elected</a> the forty-fourth President of the United States. For a few seconds, the crowd stood still, in a stunned silence. Then, the crowd let out a collective and euphoric scream. There was joy, relief, and disbelief. Tears flowed freely, strangers hugged for several minutes, others knelt and prayed. Senator John McCain’s concession speech put Obama’s election into its historic context by reminding Americans that just a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt had been vilified for inviting Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House. Obama’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K8GWCl7P7U">victory speech</a> took the high-spirited crowd even higher: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” I called my cousin, who was too filled with emotion and too mystified to complete her thought: “This country . . . This country . . . This country . . . ” she said quietly, as her voice trailed off.</p> <p>If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination and the national election, can we expect the same gathering of crowds and the same emotional outpouring? Would the historic election of the first woman President evoke a similar thrill and sense of wonderment at the leaps that this country is capable of making?</p> <p>Probably not. But why not? Is the election of a black man more revolutionary than the election of a white woman? Of course, one cannot compare the moment of an election victory of one candidate to a moment during another candidate’s campaign, a year before the election. And much of the excitement about Obama derived from the dissatisfaction with the President he was replacing. But the question remains: what’s behind the shortfall of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton?</p> <p>There are myriad reasons, and Clinton, of course, is not remotely as inspiring a speaker or campaigner as Obama. But another obvious explanation is the persistent problem of gender bias in American culture. Perhaps the sexism—in both overtly hostile and less visible but still insidious ways—has helped stoke the fires of animosity towards Clinton while, at the same time, creating an almost impossible standard for her. Unlike her male opponents, Clinton has to be far more careful and measured in what she says and does. To be free from a strict choreography of words and actions is a form of male privilege that Hillary Clinton cannot access.</p> <p>Authenticity has been a keyword during this election season. And our culture, suffused with sexism, plays the role of the arbiter of a candidate’s authenticity. Clinton must tread lightly: she cannot appear too strong without risking her likability ratings; she cannot appear too vulnerable without her credibility suffering. Herein lies Clinton’s dilemma. The Clinton campaign declared recently that Hillary would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-show-more-humor-and-heart-aides-say.html?_r=0">show more</a> of what the New York <em>Times</em> called “humor and heart,” so she learned a popular dance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” Clinton may “play the Granny card” to appear less ambitious and more friendly and family-focussed. It is hard to imagine that a man would have to do the same.</p> <p>On a more visceral level, some Americans still wince at the idea of a woman in the Oval Office. When it comes to sexism in American culture, very little has changed since the 2008 election. Indeed, things may have gotten worse. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has continued to thrive after making <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/how-trump-survived-the-megyn-kelly-blowup">unseemly comments</a> about Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his opponent <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-nose-is-growing-longer-and-longer">Carly Fiorina</a>. The conservative political blog RedState <a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/2015/08/13/conservative-blog-says-hillary-clinton-slept-her-way-into-power-after-blasting-trump-for-sexism-image/">maligned</a> Clinton as proof that “even a homely woman can sleep her way into power.” Bill Maher’s <a href="http://www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher/episodes/13/360-episode/article.html">suggestions</a> for infusing some spirit into Clinton’s “joyless” campaign were not as vicious, but they were belittling nonetheless: “See if Taylor Swift has room in her girl gang for you. . . . Lick a donut with Ariana Grande. . . . Start a Twitter war with Katy Perry and then delete your tweets.” Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s opponent, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/09/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-sexist-criticism/">summed</a> it up: “I don’t know that a man would be treated the same way that Hillary is.” He added, “Some of it is sexist.”</p> <p>Clinton, who is regularly ribbed for her signature pants suits, has tried to diffuse another issue that hounds her—her age. Recall that in 2007, when Hillary had just turned sixty, Matt Drudge printed an A.P. photo of Clinton looking fatigued, and Rush Limbaugh <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2007/12/17/does_our_looks_obsessed_culture_want_to_stare_at_an_aging_woman6">asked</a> his audience, “Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?” On Tuesday, RedState <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2015/09/22/hillary-clinton-sick-elderly-crook/">ran a piece</a> titled simply, “Hillary: sick, elderly crook.” Degrading comments about Clinton’s age represent the most unadulterated form of sexism levelled against her. In a culture obsessed with youth, fresh-faced femininity is valued while “older” women (who may be as <em>young</em> as fifty) are made to feel invisible. Tira Harpaz, writing for the blog Feministing, <a href="http://feministing.com/2013/03/22/guest-post-leaning-in-doesnt-work-for-everyone/">quipped</a> that women “have a sell by date and after that we’re pretty disposable.” In an attempt to get out ahead of the age issue, Hillary joked that she will not go gray in office as most male Presidents do, since she has been coloring her hair for years. Male candidates need not worry about coloring their hair or “growing old gracefully.”(Jeffrey Frank wrote about this today, in the context of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-presidential-age-question?intcid=mod-latest">Dwight Eisenhower’s reëlection</a>.)</p> <p>Some of the concerns about Clinton are very personal, but even these have an element of sexism in them. Many Americans, for example, feel a pointed disaffection for her. She faces what pundits call a likability problem. Voters perceive her as competent and hardworking, but not warm. A recent series of psychology studies by Princeton professor Susan Fiske showed that women who present traditionally feminine traits (stay-at-home moms, for example) are viewed as warm, but not competent, and are treated dismissively. Women considered less traditionally feminine (including lesbians, athletes, feminists, and working women) are not thought of as warm, but are perceived to be competent, and face a more antagonistic form of sexism. Women, unlike men, are rarely perceived as warm <em>and</em> competent, which, as Fiske <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/06/playing-the-granny-card/392105/">explains</a>, puts them in a “catch-22 situation.”</p> <p>So what should Hillary do? This Sunday, on “Face the Nation,” she was asked to offer three words describing herself. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/i-am-a-real-person-hillary-clinton-says/">She responded</a>, “I mean, look, I am a real person with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I’ve been in the public eye for so long that I think, you know, it’s&nbsp;like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes, ‘Real people actually go shopping,’ you know?” She was mocked, but maybe she shouldn’t have been. Perhaps the “real” Hillary Clinton is the woman who said, in a “60 Minutes” interview <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillarys-first-joint-interview-next-to-bill-in-92/">in 1992</a>, when Gennifer Flowers alleged that she had had a romantic relationship with Bill Clinton, “I’m not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.” Perhaps the “authentic” Hillary Clinton is also the woman who <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/working-moms-first-ladies-and-recalling-hillary-clintons-cookies/">famously snapped</a>, “I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession.” And maybe the “real” Hillary Clinton also tears up when she talks about her mother’s difficult childhood, her grief over her mother’s death, and her longing to have her mother by her side now. Why can’t she be all those things?</p> <p>And why can’t we be inspired by her? Clinton famously declared “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” when she spoke at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, in 1995. In 1997, as First Lady, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides health care to more than eight million children and has reduced the number of uninsured children by half. After September 11th, as a New York senator, Clinton helped to secure funding to track the health of first responders, and she has worked to expand health benefits for members of the National Guard, the Reserves, and their families. As Secretary of State, she helped open the United States’ relations with Cuba and negotiate sanctions against Iran. She also oversaw the diplomatic response to the Arab Spring. Clinton has championed children’s causes since she was the First Lady of Arkansas, and she has a long history with the Children’s Defense Fund.</p> <p>Our culture is stubborn; it changes at a glacial pace. If we look at Hillary Clinton from another angle, the enthusiasm gap is less remarkable than we thought. Perhaps it is the expected response to a complex woman who has a long and tangled history in politics. Perhaps the ambivalence toward Hillary Clinton is evidence that we still have a long way to go before we openly accept a woman who spills over the strict parameters and rigid boundaries that our culture constructs. If Hillary Clinton wins, she will become the first woman President, and her victory will be a transformative moment in our nation’s history. There will be tears, hugs, and prayers.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>It was an unseasonably warm night in Chicago.

There are just too many angles. “Why are you doing this?” my friends keep asking. Sometimes I no longer know myself.</p> <p>I am what is known as a “multimedia artist.” I chose that description because it doesn’t mean anything. Who isn’t multimedia these days? But it allows me to work in many different ways—music, writing, performance, film, electronics, and painting—without provoking the art police, who love to tell artists to get back into their category.</p> <p>For the past six months, I’ve been collaborating with a former Guantánamo detainee, Mohammed el Gharani, preparing a work of art that we are making together. From October 2nd through the 4th, we will be streaming the image of Mohammed into the Park Avenue Armory. He will be sitting in a chair in a studio in West Africa, and his live image will be broadcast to New York City and wrapped onto a large three-dimensional cast of his body. His figure—more than three times life size, inspired by the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C.—will sit in the cavernous drill hall.</p> <p>I had planned this as a meditation about real time and telepresence: how to be there and not there at the same time. Like all former Guantánamo detainees, Mohammed is not allowed to come to the U.S. I had imagined “Habeas Corpus” as a work of silent witness, deriving its power from live streaming, technology, and stillness—a work of equally balanced presence and absence.</p> <p>But things were shifting. As it turns out, my collaborator Mohammed is eager to speak about his ordeal. And once he began to talk, the project changed direction. So, in the installation, once every hour, when Mohammed takes a break in West Africa, the statue will shift to playback, and it will speak. We recorded these playback sections in June. They include several hair-raising and moving stories about Mohammed’s time in Guantánamo. We also made a film, which will be shown in an adjoining exhibition room, in which he talks at greater length about what happened to him.</p> <p>Gradually, the truth about Guantánamo has come out. For the most part, these prisoners were never the bad guys. They were not the worst of the worst. Most of them knew less about Al Qaeda than I did. They were taxi drivers, students, photographers, journalists, and goat herders. Many were purchased by the U.S. from the Northern Alliance, in Afghanistan, for five thousand dollars. Some have been held for almost fifteen years, many in solitary confinement. All interrogated. Most tortured. Most of the remaining prisoners have been cleared of all charges, but they remain in Guantánamo with no recourse.</p> <p>Mohammed was one of the youngest detainees in Guantánamo. He was imprisoned for almost eight years, between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one. He was interrogated and tortured for years, and, after the evidence against him was dismissed, he was released by a U.S. federal judge, in 2009. He is now twenty-seven and living in West Africa.</p> <p>Although my work is sometimes political, I have always tried to stay far away from polemics. I hate it when people tell me what to do. I think, “You don’t even know me! How could you possibly tell me what to do?” So I make work that’s made of questions, not answers. And, as this particular work moved away from a silent meditation toward language and stories, it came to rest on the most basic of all questions: What is truth? What is suffering? What is justice?</p> <p>The history of this project is a long one. I’ve made works using telepresence before, but, for various legal and logistical reasons, never in the United States. In 1997, I designed a work in a small town in Austria for the cultural center—a thirteenth-century church—and its neighboring high-security prison. My plan was to build a video studio in the prison, where a prisoner would sit still for two months. His image would be beamed onto a life-sized cast of his body that would be placed in the apse of the church. It would be a kind of living statue, made of light and plaster. The work, called “Life,” would be about the function of telepresence in contemporary culture and the contrasting attitudes toward the body held by the church (incarnation) and the prison (incarceration). After working on this for several months, the project was cancelled, for reasons having to do with ownership of the prisoner’s image. Once incarcerated, the prisoner no longer owns his own image and so cannot let anyone else use it. The work was never completed.</p> <p>Shortly after that, I began working on a collaboration that would have beamed prisoners at New York’s Sing Sing prison into the Whitney Museum, a work highlighting the functions of two very different heavily guarded institutions. A few weeks after this version was abandoned, for technical reasons, I was describing it to Germano Celant, a curator-at-large. An hour after our meeting, he faxed me a terse “have located prison and cultural institution.” We did the project that spring in Milan as&nbsp;a collaboration&nbsp;between the Fondazione Prada and San Vittore prison.</p> <p>The most difficult part of this work, for me, was the exploitation angle. A prisoner sits motionless for months in a museum, and I sign my name to it as “my” art work. Germano and I decided to spend time in the prison, talking to inmates and looking for a willing collaborator. The prisoners I worked with at San Vittore were white-collar criminals, extremely smart men responsible in various ways for dismantling the Italian economy. They knew Greek and Latin and were charming and courteous. They were allowed to cook in the well-equipped prison kitchen, and they had big knives and wine collections. They were busy writing books and articles and could receive visitors. Most of them were wearing Armani and, sometimes, if it was chilly, some would wear very stylish quilted vests. The only thing that was off about their outfits was the shoes. They were wearing slippers, because they were going nowhere. Ever.</p> <p>The Italian prisoners discussed the project with us while subtly directing my attention, in their expert and seemingly offhand lawyerly way, toward an inmate who was sitting quietly in the corner. Soon, I was directing all my attention and questions to him. They had, of course, decided who my collaborator would be. Santino was a bank robber and murderer, having inadvertently shot some people on his way out of the bank. He was serving a life sentence. He was also a writer. He began to engage with me in the conversation, asking questions. I said, “Santino, if we collaborate on this project, what do you think about it? How do you see it?” He said, “I see it as a virtual escape.” And I said, “You’re my man.” Finally, the show opened. It was called “Dal Vivo,” or “from life.”</p> <p>When I saw the living statue of Santino, I was shocked. He didn’t look like a prisoner. He looked like a judge. Distant. Remote. Regal. His girlfriend came to the gallery every day and stood near the statue, but he was unable to see her. The eeriness of real time.</p> <p>I had always wanted to do this telepresence project in the United States, especially given the privatization of prisons, the rising numbers of prisoners, and the staggering statistic that the U.S. now has, by far, the largest prison population in the world. So when I was invited by the Park Avenue Armory, a couple of years ago, to do an installation, I proposed a version of “Dal Vivo” that would stream the images of twelve inmates from upstate New York prisons who were serving life sentences, wrapping the projections onto three-dimensional, double-sized casts of their bodies.</p> <p>We spent months meeting people and talking to wardens. We got in touch with the Prison Mindfulness Institute and many of the organizations that work with prisoners teaching them meditation techniques. At the end of three months, we were told that Homeland Security would never allow this to happen in the U.S. because of the live-streaming element.</p> <p>Next, Alex Poots, the artistic director at the Armory, said, “O.K., what’s Plan B?” I didn’t have a Plan B. I had been so determined to make this work, and so disappointed when it didn’t happen, that I had little energy for yet another new idea. I finally came up with a halfhearted pageant—a series of events, on floats or in cars, that would represent moments in history and consciousness. The installation was going to be a road, then a zone, then a no man’s land featuring scenes of cave people looking at the moon, a backward clock, the Kennedy Cadillac in Dallas.</p> <p>I had temporarily unplugged my “tweedar”—the detector I use to measure the nauseatingly mannered content of art works. Projects like “My art is counting all the steps I took from here to the gallery and then assigning them corresponding musical notes and then playing them through the buttonholes of the shirt of my dead father.” I’ve done enough of these myself to be able to identify them pretty quickly. Nonetheless, my tweedar was locked in the red zone.</p> <p>The project was foundering. I had no idea how to push it forward anymore. Then, last March, through a series of quick and unlikely circumstances, I met Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union, who suggested getting in touch with Reprieve, an international human rights group that works with prisoners facing capital punishment as well as detainees from Guantánamo. I remember the first call I made to Reprieve. I was speaking in a high, manic voice about real time and talking statues and virtual appearance. I was talking too fast. The line kept glitching out. I was breathless, the way I get when I’m really excited about a project. It sounded idiotic and incoherent. However, after a couple of minutes, instead of a polite “thank you,” the voice on the end of the line said, “Tell me more.”</p> <p>I was talking to Kat Craig, an attorney at Reprieve, and after a couple more phone calls, she said that she&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;have a client who&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;be interested in working with me on the project. His name was Mohammed el Gharani, and he had been one of the youngest detainees at Guantánamo. She told me that he wanted to know more.</p> <p>I was dumbstruck. I began to read about Mohammed’s story. He is a Chadian who had been living in Saudi Arabia and had been captured in Pakistan in a raid on a mosque. On the Internet, there was an enormous amount of conflicting information. The basics were clear. I began to learn about the work of Reprieve and the Center for Constitutional Rights. Kat made an appointment to connect me with Mohammed.</p> <p>The first time I spoke with Mohammed was March 26th. I was getting ready to give a lecture at Harvard University. I kept losing the connection, and I was getting more and more anxious. What would this man make of this project? What could we possibly have in common? Finally, Kat completed the conference call, and I heard his voice. Light. Soft. He spoke English with a mixture of accents: Caribbean, West African, and Arabic. It was surely as awkward for him as it was for me, but we talked anyway about why and how we might do this together. Mohammed said his motivation was to help his brothers in Guantánamo.</p> <p>My work is basically about stories and what happens when they are told and retold. And what motivations might be behind alternate versions. Mohammed’s redacted story, as well as the obvious inventions about his actions, and how they arose and got entangled, became a big part of our work together.</p> <p>I have tried many times to imagine the process of interrogation. What does your own story sound like to you after so many repetitions, denials, revisions? What is it to ask and to answer hundreds of questions about your life? In his book “Guantánamo,” the French writer Frank Smith translates the transcripts of interrogations, and the interrogator and the detainee begin to merge. The French pronoun&nbsp;<em>on</em>, as in “one knows” or “one thinks”—our “royal we”—becomes more and more mysterious as we lose track of who’s asking whom and what authority is and what a story is. In the transcripts, there are also chilling pauses “No response from the detainee.” What does this pause mean? Is the detainee being waterboarded? Electroshocked? This is no ordinary conversation. It is language and stories in the service of confession, corroboration, and coercion. Among Mohammed’s first interrogators was a woman who began the session by saying, “Think of me as your mother.”</p> <p>Mohammed was accused of belonging to an Al Qaeda cell in London in 1998. At the time, Mohammed was eleven and living in Saudi Arabia with his very poor family, tending goats. The U.S. government’s story proposed that a devious and precocious child could somehow find his way from Saudi Arabia to London and link with a major terrorist operation. It was oddly satisfying that Mohammed could use the same ninja power to jump half a world away and appear, like magic, live in the U.S., sitting in the Armory.</p> <p>I spoke with a few close friends about the project, and several of them had a lot of reservations. The word “Guantánamo” sets off sirens. People would literally recoil. Their heads would move back almost as if I’d just punched them. One of the saddest parts of this project was hearing from several groups of kids who told me in different ways, somewhat shyly, that they were afraid to talk about Guantánamo because they might get “on some kind of list.”</p> <p>“You should tell it like a case of mistaken identity,” one friend advised. Another fumed, “That’s not a mistake, that’s profiling.” The more I learned about Mohammed’s capture, the more I found out about the moment when the U.S. needed to produce bad guys and used bounties, false information, torture, and fear to create the prisoners they wanted. The more I thought about Mohammed’s story, the more connected it was to profiling in general and what seemed like the weekly event of another black man getting shot by the police. I tried to stay focussed. Don’t take it all on, I told myself. I began to have nightmares, looped visions of prisons.</p> <p>Yet the more I learned, the more I realized that prosecuting “the war on terror” was all about stories. How you describe your experience. This is something I know well from my work, but I was watching it happen in the world. The U.S. government had declared the detainees “non-persons,” and so they were not eligible for apologies or reparations. The Geneva Conventions did not apply to them. They could be held indefinitely and tortured, but only because the torture was relabeled “enhanced interrogation” and because Guantánamo was not the U.S. There were also no suicides, only “manipulative self-injurious behavior.”</p> <p>Viewed from another angle, “Habeas Corpus” is also a work about cameras. I just wish Susan Sontag were still around. I know she would write a clear and killer essay about what happened when the camera and the gun got welded together and about&nbsp;how adding lenses to guns increased the deadly aim of drones and how police body cameras and bystanders’ video recordings affect police brutality. And also how cameras are used in prisons.</p> <p>My aim in this work is also to suggest some of the changes that occur in a culture that increasingly operates on remote. Many transactions happen at a distance—friendships, shopping, and even war. And cameras are the tools and links.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many of these conversations lately: Are there more crimes, or are there just more cameras? I’m thinking of the bulky box cameras that people once used to photograph lynchings in the nineteen-twenties and thirties.</p> <p>This work also became about information. While we’re proud of living in an information culture, there are huge blank spots in what we know. Guantánamo has been called the “American Gulag,” and, along with other offshore black sites, it is a blacked-out area on the map. I’m thinking of the term “information poverty.” There’s so little information about Guantánamo in the U.S. And so much resistance and fear. How can I make something that celebrates our right to find things out for ourselves? The right to be free? How can I do this without being self-righteous and strident?</p> <p>In April, I arrived at the airport in West Africa, and the hot air clobbered me. I passed signs with many exclamation marks and pictures of people with Ebola and yellow fever. A man snatched my bag. “Give me that!” I yelled, and grabbed it back. We tugged it back and forth for a while. I can’t stand it when people help me with suitcases. At the hotel, I knocked on Kat’s door. We were meeting for the first time. She was sitting in the hot room, unpacking a lot of stuff. She was friendly and chatty. She was clear and confident, and I could see why Mohammed trusts her. There was no air-conditioning in my room, and I lay down and listened to the sounds of constant heavy traffic.</p> <p>It was a sweltering morning, and I decided to do T’ai Chi in the hotel’s airless gym. “Listen behind you,” are my teacher’s instructions about how to begin T’ai Chi. I was working on the nineteen form and suddenly felt someone looking at me. I turned around and saw a gap-toothed man in his twenties. He gave a half wave and then left. Later that morning, I met him again. He was with Kat, who introduced him as my collaborator, Mohammed el Gharani. The three of us&nbsp;talked for hours in one of the hotel rooms. There was a lot of secrecy around the meetings. Kat was always present. The bond between the two of them was touching. We stopped several times and left Mohammed alone in the room so that he could pray.</p> <p>At first, Mohammed and I were both shy and hesitant. I was one of the few Americans he had met who wasn’t his interrogator, torturer, or guard. I had never talked with someone like him before. I was acutely aware of his physical presence. His back had been seriously injured. He was still missing teeth. His head had been smashed. I couldn’t forget, even for a minute, that it was my country that had done this. It kept making me feel like throwing up. Later, we talked outside in the sweltering courtyard. Mohammed is a runner, and we discussed how hard it is to run in the heat. He said he has two kids.</p> <p>We went back to the room, and I set up two small clay figures and closed the drapes. I aimed the projector at them, and they sprang to life. I tried to explain: so this will be you, but very big, and it will all happen in a huge space. I showed him pictures of the Park Avenue Armory. We looked at the tiny glowing figures. I doubt that I was giving him any idea of what I was trying to do.</p> <p>I had a lot of questions, but only managed to ask a few, and they were oblique. I listened. Sometimes I talked about my meditation teacher. I told Mohammed that my teacher said, “Try to practice how to feel sad without actually being sad.” We talked about whether that was really possible. We talked about people who were inspiring. He talked about Nelson Mandela. I talked about my friends and family and the death of my husband. Once in a while, Mohammed bent his head and cried. How was it possible for him to be here talking to me at all? Kat reminded me that asking questions had been central to all his interrogations, and she said that, as his lawyer, she had to remind herself—and him, too—that he didn’t have to answer the questions if he didn’t want to. Mohammed learned English in prison. The first words he learned were, as he put it, “the ‘F’ and the ‘N’ words, because that’s what the Americans called me.”</p> <p>We drove around with our producer. The sky was dark purple and stormy, the pollution was chokingly thick. We visited several furniture stores looking for the Lay-Z-Boy-style chair that Mohammed would sit in. Since his back had been injured in the torture sessions and stressful physical situations were part of his prison experience, we decided to build a chair, designed especially for him, that would provide enough support to him to sit for long periods of time.</p> <p>Kat and I also looked for new eyeglasses for Mohammed because the glasses he was wearing automatically darken in the light, and we wanted to be able to see his eyes in the projection. Kat is thorough, relentless, kind, and efficient. I told her that these conversations were making me feel so physically sick, giving me constant headaches. I asked her how she could stand knowing so many details about this much suffering. She gave me a brisk, professional answer. Lawyers, actors, and lots of other people, too, have an armor that separates and protects them from their jobs. I don’t have that, and it was starting to become really difficult.</p> <p>On later days, Kat and Mohammed and I would talk for hours in the hotel room. He told us about the guard who told all the prisoners, “See this thick wall? You will never get out, and I will throw the key into the ocean, and you’ll be here forever, and my grandson will be guarding you.” He talked about interrogation and about the guards who were taken to Ground Zero before going to Guantánamo. He talked about missing his family. He described pepper spray and forcible cell extraction. He talked about being shackled and blindfolded and thrown onto a plane. We jumped around between the years that he was in the camp and his release. His stories transfixed me. They rolled out in long sentences. He described the day that a detainee told his interrogator that he’d had a dream that a submarine came to Guantánamo to rescue the detainees. That night, he said, Guantánamo Bay was filled with helicopters and ships with their searchlights on, looking for the dream submarine.</p> <p>We continued after lunch. He said that one of the hardest things to endure was that there was no logic or reason or even pattern to the torture, and that was one of the reasons it drove people crazy. It was random, sudden. He described arriving on the plane with no idea where he was. After almost eight years, his release was finally ordered. He then spent six months in Camp Iguana, where he was constantly asked, “Do you hate Americans?”</p> <p>For Mohammed, there had been no explanation. “After all this, what is justice for you, Mohammed?” I asked.</p> <p>“An apology,” he said.</p> <p>Back in New York, we began to assemble the team for cutting the statue. The plans for the live feed got more specific, elaborate. The brilliant technical director designed increasingly redundant systems for the intercontinental transmissions.</p> <p>I met with a friend of mine who is a judge, and I described the project to her. She leaned in toward me and said in a half voice: “Do you have legal representation?&nbsp;” Even though I know my friend and she was sitting there in running shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt, her voice had the tone of a judge, and it had not occurred to me to get a lawyer. Her concern and authority suddenly made me very nervous. I thought of all the times in my life when I’ve been completely unqualified to be where I was. This seemed to be one of them.</p> <p>I flashed back to the night, long ago, when I was playing at the Berlin Jazz Festival. I was in the middle of one of my songs, which are basically stories with many conversational-like pauses. A man from the back of the hall used one of these pauses to yell, “Play jazz!” I froze. He had a point. This was a jazz festival. The problem was that I didn’t know any jazz.</p> <p>In June, I took my next trip back to Africa. We had assembled a team to shoot the first phase of the project, and we met at the studio. To create the effect of a person sitting in a chair, the figure actually has to be tilted backward, reclining slightly, as if in a business-class airplane seat. Kat, Mohammed, and I talked about what he would say for the playback section of the installation.</p> <p>We talked about torture and&nbsp;ERFing, waterboarding, and solitary confinement. I began to feel the way I did when I saw the first images of Abu Ghraib. Nauseated. Hot. I could hear myself speed-talking: “But Americans! We’re …we’re …we’re good people,” I was saying. “We’re generous, and we help people.” I kept offering up examples of American generosity. Next, we talked about hunger strikes and beatings. Mohammed concluded his stories looking right into the camera lens and addressing President Obama, “Please honor your promise and close Guantánamo,” he said, calmly. I noticed that Kat was quietly crying, her armor not as thick as I had imagined. And I could see that she was crying because Mohammed was speaking for himself, and because he was so clear and assertive.</p> <p>I thought of how lucky I was to be working with Mohammed, who is articulate, likable, handsome, and humble. His skills and personality were making the project so easy to do.&nbsp;I know of several human-rights groups who have exhibited paintings and published the poems of prisoners in a well-intentioned effort to show the humanity of the prisoners they work with. While I admire this, it has always bothered me a bit, too. Why should the prisoners have to be creative and likable people? I wanted to think that if the detainee that Reprieve had recommended to me was angry, bitter, and couldn’t write a poem to save his life, I would still want to work with him. Then again, maybe my own ego was starting to get involved. And I didn’t want that to happen.</p> <p>As an artist, I am committed to seeing things the way they are, not the way I think they could be or should be. But faced with the facts of American racism, sexism, law breaking, and violence, I’m having a hard time maintaining my belief in the across-the-board openheartedness of my countrymen. Also, although there are journalistic aspects to this project, I am an artist first, so, if faced with having to choose between something beautiful&nbsp;and something true, I would choose the beautiful, because I trust my senses more than my rational mind.</p> <p>The talks went on. We talked about Shaker Aamer. Shaker, the last remaining British resident at Guantánamo who was pulled in at the same time as Mohammed, was brought to Guantánamo on the same plane, shackled, and blindfolded. He had taken care of Mohammed and had become his mentor. The only time that Mohammed cried was when he talked about people who had been kind to him. When he talked about Shaker, he broke down. Shaker Aamer is still in Guantánamo, now in solitary confinement. The day that Mohammed was released, he was the only one who was able to yell to him, “All the best! Goodbye! Goodbye!”</p> <p>Right now we are in the late stages of planning. The exhibition is becoming real. It’s going to be a crazy week. We finished carving the statue of Mohammed, and it looks like a Cubist work, a series of sliding planes to accommodate the projection. We’re preparing the live show that will happen each night. I’ve just heard that Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, will come to New York for the show’s opening.</p> <p>I’m holding my breath.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>I’ve been trying to describe <a href="http://armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/laurie_anderson">an upcoming project</a> called “Habeas Corpus,” and it’s much harder than I thought. There are just too many angles. “Why are you doing this?” my friends keep asking. Sometimes I no longer know myself.</p> <p>I am what is known as a “multimedia artist.” I chose that description because it doesn’t mean anything. Who isn’t multimedia these days? But it allows me to work in many different ways—music, writing, performance, film, electronics, and painting—without provoking the art police, who love to tell artists to get back into their category.</p> <p>For the past six months, I’ve been collaborating with a former Guantánamo detainee, Mohammed el Gharani, preparing a work of art that we are making together. From October 2nd through the 4th, we will be streaming the image of Mohammed into the Park Avenue Armory. He will be sitting in a chair in a studio in West Africa, and his live image will be broadcast to New York City and wrapped onto a large three-dimensional cast of his body. His figure—more than three times life size, inspired by the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C.—will sit in the cavernous drill hall.</p> <p>I had planned this as a meditation about real time and telepresence: how to be there and not there at the same time. Like all former Guantánamo detainees, Mohammed is not allowed to come to the U.S. I had imagined “Habeas Corpus” as a work of silent witness, deriving its power from live streaming, technology, and stillness—a work of equally balanced presence and absence.</p> <p>But things were shifting. As it turns out, my collaborator Mohammed is eager to speak about his ordeal. And once he began to talk, the project changed direction. So, in the installation, once every hour, when Mohammed takes a break in West Africa, the statue will shift to playback, and it will speak. We recorded these playback sections in June. They include several hair-raising and moving stories about Mohammed’s time in Guantánamo. We also made a film, which will be shown in an adjoining exhibition room, in which he talks at greater length about what happened to him.</p> <p>Gradually, the truth about Guantánamo has come out. For the most part, these prisoners were never the bad guys. They were not the worst of the worst. Most of them knew less about Al Qaeda than I did. They were taxi drivers, students, photographers, journalists, and goat herders. Many were purchased by the U.S. from the Northern Alliance, in Afghanistan, for five thousand dollars. Some have been held for almost fifteen years, many in solitary confinement. All interrogated. Most tortured. Most of the remaining prisoners have been cleared of all charges, but they remain in Guantánamo with no recourse.</p> <p>Mohammed was one of the youngest detainees in Guantánamo. He was imprisoned for almost eight years, between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one. He was interrogated and tortured for years, and, after the evidence against him was dismissed, he was released by a U.S. federal judge, in 2009. He is now twenty-seven and living in West Africa.</p> <p>Although my work is sometimes political, I have always tried to stay far away from polemics. I hate it when people tell me what to do. I think, “You don’t even know me! How could you possibly tell me what to do?” So I make work that’s made of questions, not answers. And, as this particular work moved away from a silent meditation toward language and stories, it came to rest on the most basic of all questions: What is truth? What is suffering? What is justice?</p> <p>The history of this project is a long one. I’ve made works using telepresence before, but, for various legal and logistical reasons, never in the United States. In 1997, I designed a work in a small town in Austria for the cultural center—a thirteenth-century church—and its neighboring high-security prison. My plan was to build a video studio in the prison, where a prisoner would sit still for two months. His image would be beamed onto a life-sized cast of his body that would be placed in the apse of the church. It would be a kind of living statue, made of light and plaster. The work, called “Life,” would be about the function of telepresence in contemporary culture and the contrasting attitudes toward the body held by the church (incarnation) and the prison (incarceration). After working on this for several months, the project was cancelled, for reasons having to do with ownership of the prisoner’s image. Once incarcerated, the prisoner no longer owns his own image and so cannot let anyone else use it. The work was never completed.</p> <p>Shortly after that, I began working on a collaboration that would have beamed prisoners at New York’s Sing Sing prison into the Whitney Museum, a work highlighting the functions of two very different heavily guarded institutions. A few weeks after this version was abandoned, for technical reasons, I was describing it to Germano Celant, a curator-at-large. An hour after our meeting, he faxed me a terse “have located prison and cultural institution.” We did the project that spring in Milan as&nbsp;a collaboration&nbsp;between the Fondazione Prada and San Vittore prison.</p> <p>The most difficult part of this work, for me, was the exploitation angle. A prisoner sits motionless for months in a museum, and I sign my name to it as “my” art work. Germano and I decided to spend time in the prison, talking to inmates and looking for a willing collaborator. The prisoners I worked with at San Vittore were white-collar criminals, extremely smart men responsible in various ways for dismantling the Italian economy. They knew Greek and Latin and were charming and courteous. They were allowed to cook in the well-equipped prison kitchen, and they had big knives and wine collections. They were busy writing books and articles and could receive visitors. Most of them were wearing Armani and, sometimes, if it was chilly, some would wear very stylish quilted vests. The only thing that was off about their outfits was the shoes. They were wearing slippers, because they were going nowhere. Ever.</p> <p>The Italian prisoners discussed the project with us while subtly directing my attention, in their expert and seemingly offhand lawyerly way, toward an inmate who was sitting quietly in the corner. Soon, I was directing all my attention and questions to him. They had, of course, decided who my collaborator would be. Santino was a bank robber and murderer, having inadvertently shot some people on his way out of the bank. He was serving a life sentence. He was also a writer. He began to engage with me in the conversation, asking questions. I said, “Santino, if we collaborate on this project, what do you think about it? How do you see it?” He said, “I see it as a virtual escape.” And I said, “You’re my man.” Finally, the show opened. It was called “Dal Vivo,” or “from life.”</p> <p>When I saw the living statue of Santino, I was shocked. He didn’t look like a prisoner. He looked like a judge. Distant. Remote. Regal. His girlfriend came to the gallery every day and stood near the statue, but he was unable to see her. The eeriness of real time.</p> <p>I had always wanted to do this telepresence project in the United States, especially given the privatization of prisons, the rising numbers of prisoners, and the staggering statistic that the U.S. now has, by far, the largest prison population in the world. So when I was invited by the Park Avenue Armory, a couple of years ago, to do an installation, I proposed a version of “Dal Vivo” that would stream the images of twelve inmates from upstate New York prisons who were serving life sentences, wrapping the projections onto three-dimensional, double-sized casts of their bodies.</p> <p>We spent months meeting people and talking to wardens. We got in touch with the Prison Mindfulness Institute and many of the organizations that work with prisoners teaching them meditation techniques. At the end of three months, we were told that Homeland Security would never allow this to happen in the U.S. because of the live-streaming element.</p> <p>Next, Alex Poots, the artistic director at the Armory, said, “O.K., what’s Plan B?” I didn’t have a Plan B. I had been so determined to make this work, and so disappointed when it didn’t happen, that I had little energy for yet another new idea. I finally came up with a halfhearted pageant—a series of events, on floats or in cars, that would represent moments in history and consciousness. The installation was going to be a road, then a zone, then a no man’s land featuring scenes of cave people looking at the moon, a backward clock, the Kennedy Cadillac in Dallas.</p> <p>I had temporarily unplugged my “tweedar”—the detector I use to measure the nauseatingly mannered content of art works. Projects like “My art is counting all the steps I took from here to the gallery and then assigning them corresponding musical notes and then playing them through the buttonholes of the shirt of my dead father.” I’ve done enough of these myself to be able to identify them pretty quickly. Nonetheless, my tweedar was locked in the red zone.</p> <p>The project was foundering. I had no idea how to push it forward anymore. Then, last March, through a series of quick and unlikely circumstances, I met Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union, who suggested getting in touch with Reprieve, an international human rights group that works with prisoners facing capital punishment as well as detainees from Guantánamo. I remember the first call I made to Reprieve. I was speaking in a high, manic voice about real time and talking statues and virtual appearance. I was talking too fast. The line kept glitching out. I was breathless, the way I get when I’m really excited about a project. It sounded idiotic and incoherent. However, after a couple of minutes, instead of a polite “thank you,” the voice on the end of the line said, “Tell me more.”</p> <p>I was talking to Kat Craig, an attorney at Reprieve, and after a couple more phone calls, she said that she&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;have a client who&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;be interested in working with me on the project. His name was Mohammed el Gharani, and he had been one of the youngest detainees at Guantánamo. She told me that he wanted to know more.</p> <p>I was dumbstruck. I began to read about Mohammed’s story. He is a Chadian who had been living in Saudi Arabia and had been captured in Pakistan in a raid on a mosque. On the Internet, there was an enormous amount of conflicting information. The basics were clear. I began to learn about the work of Reprieve and the Center for Constitutional Rights. Kat made an appointment to connect me with Mohammed.</p> <p>The first time I spoke with Mohammed was March 26th. I was getting ready to give a lecture at Harvard University. I kept losing the connection, and I was getting more and more anxious. What would this man make of this project? What could we possibly have in common? Finally, Kat completed the conference call, and I heard his voice. Light. Soft. He spoke English with a mixture of accents: Caribbean, West African, and Arabic. It was surely as awkward for him as it was for me, but we talked anyway about why and how we might do this together. Mohammed said his motivation was to help his brothers in Guantánamo.</p> <p>My work is basically about stories and what happens when they are told and retold. And what motivations might be behind alternate versions. Mohammed’s redacted story, as well as the obvious inventions about his actions, and how they arose and got entangled, became a big part of our work together.</p> <p>I have tried many times to imagine the process of interrogation. What does your own story sound like to you after so many repetitions, denials, revisions? What is it to ask and to answer hundreds of questions about your life? In his book “Guantánamo,” the French writer Frank Smith translates the transcripts of interrogations, and the interrogator and the detainee begin to merge. The French pronoun&nbsp;<em>on</em>, as in “one knows” or “one thinks”—our “royal we”—becomes more and more mysterious as we lose track of who’s asking whom and what authority is and what a story is. In the transcripts, there are also chilling pauses “No response from the detainee.” What does this pause mean? Is the detainee being waterboarded? Electroshocked? This is no ordinary conversation. It is language and stories in the service of confession, corroboration, and coercion. Among Mohammed’s first interrogators was a woman who began the session by saying, “Think of me as your mother.”</p> <p>Mohammed was accused of belonging to an Al Qaeda cell in London in 1998. At the time, Mohammed was eleven and living in Saudi Arabia with his very poor family, tending goats. The U.S. government’s story proposed that a devious and precocious child could somehow find his way from Saudi Arabia to London and link with a major terrorist operation. It was oddly satisfying that Mohammed could use the same ninja power to jump half a world away and appear, like magic, live in the U.S., sitting in the Armory.</p> <p>I spoke with a few close friends about the project, and several of them had a lot of reservations. The word “Guantánamo” sets off sirens. People would literally recoil. Their heads would move back almost as if I’d just punched them. One of the saddest parts of this project was hearing from several groups of kids who told me in different ways, somewhat shyly, that they were afraid to talk about Guantánamo because they might get “on some kind of list.”</p> <p>“You should tell it like a case of mistaken identity,” one friend advised. Another fumed, “That’s not a mistake, that’s profiling.” The more I learned about Mohammed’s capture, the more I found out about the moment when the U.S. needed to produce bad guys and used bounties, false information, torture, and fear to create the prisoners they wanted. The more I thought about Mohammed’s story, the more connected it was to profiling in general and what seemed like the weekly event of another black man getting shot by the police. I tried to stay focussed. Don’t take it all on, I told myself. I began to have nightmares, looped visions of prisons.</p> <p>Yet the more I learned, the more I realized that prosecuting “the war on terror” was all about stories. How you describe your experience. This is something I know well from my work, but I was watching it happen in the world. The U.S. government had declared the detainees “non-persons,” and so they were not eligible for apologies or reparations. The Geneva Conventions did not apply to them. They could be held indefinitely and tortured, but only because the torture was relabeled “enhanced interrogation” and because Guantánamo was not the U.S. There were also no suicides, only “manipulative self-injurious behavior.”</p> <p>Viewed from another angle, “Habeas Corpus” is also a work about cameras. I just wish Susan Sontag were still around. I know she would write a clear and killer essay about what happened when the camera and the gun got welded together and about&nbsp;how adding lenses to guns increased the deadly aim of drones and how police body cameras and bystanders’ video recordings affect police brutality. And also how cameras are used in prisons.</p> <p>My aim in this work is also to suggest some of the changes that occur in a culture that increasingly operates on remote. Many transactions happen at a distance—friendships, shopping, and even war. And cameras are the tools and links.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many of these conversations lately: Are there more crimes, or are there just more cameras? I’m thinking of the bulky box cameras that people once used to photograph lynchings in the nineteen-twenties and thirties.</p> <p>This work also became about information. While we’re proud of living in an information culture, there are huge blank spots in what we know. Guantánamo has been called the “American Gulag,” and, along with other offshore black sites, it is a blacked-out area on the map. I’m thinking of the term “information poverty.” There’s so little information about Guantánamo in the U.S. And so much resistance and fear. How can I make something that celebrates our right to find things out for ourselves? The right to be free? How can I do this without being self-righteous and strident?</p> <p>In April, I arrived at the airport in West Africa, and the hot air clobbered me. I passed signs with many exclamation marks and pictures of people with Ebola and yellow fever. A man snatched my bag. “Give me that!” I yelled, and grabbed it back. We tugged it back and forth for a while. I can’t stand it when people help me with suitcases. At the hotel, I knocked on Kat’s door. We were meeting for the first time. She was sitting in the hot room, unpacking a lot of stuff. She was friendly and chatty. She was clear and confident, and I could see why Mohammed trusts her. There was no air-conditioning in my room, and I lay down and listened to the sounds of constant heavy traffic.</p> <p>It was a sweltering morning, and I decided to do T’ai Chi in the hotel’s airless gym. “Listen behind you,” are my teacher’s instructions about how to begin T’ai Chi. I was working on the nineteen form and suddenly felt someone looking at me. I turned around and saw a gap-toothed man in his twenties. He gave a half wave and then left. Later that morning, I met him again. He was with Kat, who introduced him as my collaborator, Mohammed el Gharani. The three of us&nbsp;talked for hours in one of the hotel rooms. There was a lot of secrecy around the meetings. Kat was always present. The bond between the two of them was touching. We stopped several times and left Mohammed alone in the room so that he could pray.</p> <p>At first, Mohammed and I were both shy and hesitant. I was one of the few Americans he had met who wasn’t his interrogator, torturer, or guard. I had never talked with someone like him before. I was acutely aware of his physical presence. His back had been seriously injured. He was still missing teeth. His head had been smashed. I couldn’t forget, even for a minute, that it was my country that had done this. It kept making me feel like throwing up. Later, we talked outside in the sweltering courtyard. Mohammed is a runner, and we discussed how hard it is to run in the heat. He said he has two kids.</p> <p>We went back to the room, and I set up two small clay figures and closed the drapes. I aimed the projector at them, and they sprang to life. I tried to explain: so this will be you, but very big, and it will all happen in a huge space. I showed him pictures of the Park Avenue Armory. We looked at the tiny glowing figures. I doubt that I was giving him any idea of what I was trying to do.</p> <p>I had a lot of questions, but only managed to ask a few, and they were oblique. I listened. Sometimes I talked about my meditation teacher. I told Mohammed that my teacher said, “Try to practice how to feel sad without actually being sad.” We talked about whether that was really possible. We talked about people who were inspiring. He talked about Nelson Mandela. I talked about my friends and family and the death of my husband. Once in a while, Mohammed bent his head and cried. How was it possible for him to be here talking to me at all? Kat reminded me that asking questions had been central to all his interrogations, and she said that, as his lawyer, she had to remind herself—and him, too—that he didn’t have to answer the questions if he didn’t want to. Mohammed learned English in prison. The first words he learned were, as he put it, “the ‘F’ and the ‘N’ words, because that’s what the Americans called me.”</p> <p>We drove around with our producer. The sky was dark purple and stormy, the pollution was chokingly thick. We visited several furniture stores looking for the Lay-Z-Boy-style chair that Mohammed would sit in. Since his back had been injured in the torture sessions and stressful physical situations were part of his prison experience, we decided to build a chair, designed especially for him, that would provide enough support to him to sit for long periods of time.</p> <p>Kat and I also looked for new eyeglasses for Mohammed because the glasses he was wearing automatically darken in the light, and we wanted to be able to see his eyes in the projection. Kat is thorough, relentless, kind, and efficient. I told her that these conversations were making me feel so physically sick, giving me constant headaches. I asked her how she could stand knowing so many details about this much suffering. She gave me a brisk, professional answer. Lawyers, actors, and lots of other people, too, have an armor that separates and protects them from their jobs. I don’t have that, and it was starting to become really difficult.</p> <p>On later days, Kat and Mohammed and I would talk for hours in the hotel room. He told us about the guard who told all the prisoners, “See this thick wall? You will never get out, and I will throw the key into the ocean, and you’ll be here forever, and my grandson will be guarding you.” He talked about interrogation and about the guards who were taken to Ground Zero before going to Guantánamo. He talked about missing his family. He described pepper spray and forcible cell extraction. He talked about being shackled and blindfolded and thrown onto a plane. We jumped around between the years that he was in the camp and his release. His stories transfixed me. They rolled out in long sentences. He described the day that a detainee told his interrogator that he’d had a dream that a submarine came to Guantánamo to rescue the detainees. That night, he said, Guantánamo Bay was filled with helicopters and ships with their searchlights on, looking for the dream submarine.</p> <p>We continued after lunch. He said that one of the hardest things to endure was that there was no logic or reason or even pattern to the torture, and that was one of the reasons it drove people crazy. It was random, sudden. He described arriving on the plane with no idea where he was. After almost eight years, his release was finally ordered. He then spent six months in Camp Iguana, where he was constantly asked, “Do you hate Americans?”</p> <p>For Mohammed, there had been no explanation. “After all this, what is justice for you, Mohammed?” I asked.</p> <p>“An apology,” he said.</p> <p>Back in New York, we began to assemble the team for cutting the statue. The plans for the live feed got more specific, elaborate. The brilliant technical director designed increasingly redundant systems for the intercontinental transmissions.</p> <p>I met with a friend of mine who is a judge, and I described the project to her. She leaned in toward me and said in a half voice: “Do you have legal representation?&nbsp;” Even though I know my friend and she was sitting there in running shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt, her voice had the tone of a judge, and it had not occurred to me to get a lawyer. Her concern and authority suddenly made me very nervous. I thought of all the times in my life when I’ve been completely unqualified to be where I was. This seemed to be one of them.</p> <p>I flashed back to the night, long ago, when I was playing at the Berlin Jazz Festival. I was in the middle of one of my songs, which are basically stories with many conversational-like pauses. A man from the back of the hall used one of these pauses to yell, “Play jazz!” I froze. He had a point. This was a jazz festival. The problem was that I didn’t know any jazz.</p> <p>In June, I took my next trip back to Africa. We had assembled a team to shoot the first phase of the project, and we met at the studio. To create the effect of a person sitting in a chair, the figure actually has to be tilted backward, reclining slightly, as if in a business-class airplane seat. Kat, Mohammed, and I talked about what he would say for the playback section of the installation.</p> <p>We talked about torture and&nbsp;ERFing, waterboarding, and solitary confinement. I began to feel the way I did when I saw the first images of Abu Ghraib. Nauseated. Hot. I could hear myself speed-talking: “But Americans! We’re …we’re …we’re good people,” I was saying. “We’re generous, and we help people.” I kept offering up examples of American generosity. Next, we talked about hunger strikes and beatings. Mohammed concluded his stories looking right into the camera lens and addressing President Obama, “Please honor your promise and close Guantánamo,” he said, calmly. I noticed that Kat was quietly crying, her armor not as thick as I had imagined. And I could see that she was crying because Mohammed was speaking for himself, and because he was so clear and assertive.</p> <p>I thought of how lucky I was to be working with Mohammed, who is articulate, likable, handsome, and humble. His skills and personality were making the project so easy to do.&nbsp;I know of several human-rights groups who have exhibited paintings and published the poems of prisoners in a well-intentioned effort to show the humanity of the prisoners they work with. While I admire this, it has always bothered me a bit, too. Why should the prisoners have to be creative and likable people? I wanted to think that if the detainee that Reprieve had recommended to me was angry, bitter, and couldn’t write a poem to save his life, I would still want to work with him. Then again, maybe my own ego was starting to get involved. And I didn’t want that to happen.</p> <p>As an artist, I am committed to seeing things the way they are, not the way I think they could be or should be. But faced with the facts of American racism, sexism, law breaking, and violence, I’m having a hard time maintaining my belief in the across-the-board openheartedness of my countrymen. Also, although there are journalistic aspects to this project, I am an artist first, so, if faced with having to choose between something beautiful&nbsp;and something true, I would choose the beautiful, because I trust my senses more than my rational mind.</p> <p>The talks went on. We talked about Shaker Aamer. Shaker, the last remaining British resident at Guantánamo who was pulled in at the same time as Mohammed, was brought to Guantánamo on the same plane, shackled, and blindfolded. He had taken care of Mohammed and had become his mentor. The only time that Mohammed cried was when he talked about people who had been kind to him. When he talked about Shaker, he broke down. Shaker Aamer is still in Guantánamo, now in solitary confinement. The day that Mohammed was released, he was the only one who was able to yell to him, “All the best! Goodbye! Goodbye!”</p> <p>Right now we are in the late stages of planning. The exhibition is becoming real. It’s going to be a crazy week. We finished carving the statue of Mohammed, and it looks like a Cubist work, a series of sliding planes to accommodate the projection. We’re preparing the live show that will happen each night. I’ve just heard that Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, will come to New York for the show’s opening.</p> <p>I’m holding my breath.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

(Theme: Straight Outta Iowa.)

This was Iowa, five months before the caucuses. The floodlights of a CNN truck illuminated the scene. A campaign bus, its blue sides emblazoned with “Trump: #Make America Great Again!” in white letters, sat at the edge of the parking lot.

I was like, ‘What if we got a presidential candidate here?’ We’re Iowa, it could happen.”</p> <p>Her students started tweeting, e-mailing, calling, writing letters, sidewalk chalking outside candidates’ Iowa offices, asking, “Will you come to homecoming?” in multi-colored pleas.</p> <p>“We tried to get every party, every candidate,” La Pietra said. “We thought we’d have better luck getting a smaller candidate, but we got the big one.”</p> <p>(Bernie Sanders, the Democratic Presidential candidate, later tweeted, “Dear Urbandale HS students: Sorry I can’t make the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UHSPresiDance?src=hash"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">#</span>UHSPresiDance</a>! Hope you have fun at homecoming and I’d love to visit your school soon.” The tweet was favorited more than fourteen hundred times.)</p> <p>This being high school, La Pietra heard the good news in the usual way: she was called to the office. There, a senior Trump official told her that Trump would love to come to homecoming. That was on Wednesday, the day of the second Republican debate. The students found out two days later, at homecoming coronation.</p> <p>“It’s awesome for me as a government teacher, because I’ve never seen them this excited about government. Now for the rest of the year, they’re going to be more engaged,” La Pietra said. “We told everyone, whether you support him, whether you don’t support him, it’s fine either way. Just hear what he has to say in person, because that’s so rare. Most people across the country don’t get to have that opportunity. So you do. Hear him out. Then you decide. Hate him, love him, whatever you want to do.”</p> <p>Urbandale, population forty-three thousand, is a mostly middle-class place, with pockets of wealth and higher-than-average home prices. Like much of Iowa, it’s mostly white, but also has a growing Hispanic population. Urbandale High is the only high school in the district. Twenty-one per cent of the school’s twelve hundred and sixty-seven students are minorities. More than twenty-five per cent are from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>As the sun set, Trump took the stage, sounding a bit like somebody’s uncle, eager to connect with the young folk, but shaky on the lingo.</p> <p>“First of all, I have to congratulate the J-Hawks,” he said. “You had a big night last night, right? It was triple overtime, and then you broke ’em down. Is that what happened?”</p> <p>He congratulated La Pietra, whom he called Annie, and the school’s principal. (“I said, ‘Come to New York, run a school in New York. Let’s see how you do with that.’ That’s not so easy, right?”) He thanked Tana Goertz, a former star of “The Apprentice,” who co-chairs his campaign here.</p> <p>“How are we doing in Iowa?” Trump asked, and then answered his own question: “We’re killing it.” (In fact, according to the latest polls, Trump maintains a sizable lead over the other Republican candidates.)</p> <p>He turned his attention to the students, whom he described as, “So young. So young and beautiful and attractive.”</p> <p>He couldn’t help himself from pointing out, “I get millions of dollars to speak, and I’m doing this for nothing.”</p> <p>“You represent the future,” he told the students, before warning them to stay away from alcohol and drugs and, if they can help it, cigarettes. “Who’s avoiding cigarettes? Who smokes? Raise your hand.”</p> <p>He added earnestly, “You just have to follow your heart and you’ll be successful. And it may not be pure monetary success, because I know people that are the wealthiest people in the world and they’re not happy.”</p> <p>Some dance-attendees skipped the hoopla altogether, arriving only after Trump left. Others said that they wanted his picture, but they supported Bernie Sanders for President. During a question-and-answer session, one student asked Trump whether he would consider appointing a Muslim to his Cabinet.</p> <p>Trump answered, “Would I consider putting a Muslim-American in my Cabinet? Absolutely, no problem with that. O.K.?”</p> <p>A young woman then asked about his frequent misogynistic comments.</p> <p>“I think women are the greatest,” Trump said. “I think they’re superior to men. Women. No, let me change that. I think they’re <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em>far</em></span> superior to men. Women are—they’re great. And I will take care of women’s health issues.” After a slight detour into criticizing his Republican opponent Jeb Bush’s policies on women, Trump finished by saying, “I have a great respect for women. As I say, I cherish women and they are the greatest. O.K.?”</p> <p>Trump then signed autographs and posed with the homecoming king and queen in their crowns, high-fiving the king. Several adults in the crowd said that they appreciated the way he tailored the speech to the students, rather than making the usual canned campaign-stop remarks.</p> <p>In the two years leading up to any Presidential election, most Iowans need not seek out a candidate to see one. Candidates show up at local restaurants and gas stations, at college football games, at the State Fair. Their ads saturate evening TV. (Though La Pietra said that her students largely avoid this annoyance because they watch everything on Netflix.) This year, with so many candidates trying to distinguish themselves from the pack, some adults are experiencing fatigue. But Trump’s appeal to a teen-age audience seemed to breathe new life into the act.</p> <p>For those students who will be eighteen come November, 2016, La Pietra said, “They saw that we can make a difference in government. We can get attention not just at the local level but nationally. I’d bet all of them will go vote next year.” (She declined to say for whom.)</p> <p>As the crowd dispersed, Chaz Nell and Erik Ly, both fourteen-year-old freshmen, took turns posing at the lectern, with hands raised, Nixon-like, in a double “V.”</p> <p>Nell wore a black suit, a boutonnière in his lapel, and a tie printed with pictures of hundred-dollar bills.</p> <p>“He signed my tie,” he said giddily, holding it forth as he rattled off a list of great Presidents who, like Trump, were also businessmen.</p> <p>Ly’s parents are diehard Hillary Clinton supporters. “Ours is a house divided,” he said. He admitted that he fell for Obama’s charms the first time around (when he was seven), but he said that now he is solidly for Trump. The latter-day Alex P.

Radical Islam is on the rise. <small>ISIS</small> is sawing people’s heads off. Putin’s expanding into Crimea. China’s building up their military and hacking our computers. And, frankly, our allies in the Middle East have requested help from us to help them defeat <small>ISIS</small>. Obama did nothing to help them, and now they’re turning to Vladimir Putin for help. He’s trying to grow Russia’s influence, he’s trying to replace us as a world power. This is the disaster of the Obama foreign policy: leading from behind.”</p> <p>It was suggested that Erik Ly might make a great running mate for Donald Trump.</p> <p>“The only thing keeping Erik from being president,” Nell said, “is his age and his clip-on tie.”</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Saturday night was the annual homecoming dance in Urbandale, a suburb of Des Moines.

That’s the time when South Boston, the largely Irish neighborhood where Bulger grew up, lived, and operated, was national news, mostly in conjunction with one word, “busing.” In 1974, a federal judge ordered that Boston’s public schools be desegregated by sending white students from schools in South Boston to schools in the predominantly black neighborhood of Roxbury, and vice versa. Many residents of South Boston responded with fury, threatening violence against the black students who arrived by bus. Most white children being bused refused to go.</p> <p>From watching “Black Mass,” you’d never know that these events coincided in any way with those seen in the movie or that any of the movie’s characters had anything to do with them. But one of them—William Bulger, the gangster’s brother (portrayed in the film by Benedict Cumberbatch)—was a state senator at the time, representing South Boston, and he himself made national news, as in <a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/12/20/78276493.html?pageNumber=28">this report</a> from the <em>Times</em>, from 1975, forecasting the following year’s Democratic Presidential primary in Massachusetts:</p> <blockquote word_count="62" data-wc="62"> <p>The virulence of that shocking remark suggests the tone and the import of the conflict in South Boston at the time. Yes, “Black Mass” is about gangsters, and William Bulger plays merely a supporting role, but not even mentioning the busing crisis in the course of the action would be akin to not mentioning the police assault on Rodney King and the resulting riots in Los Angeles in the course of “Straight Outta Compton.”</p> <p>That’s because the very subject of “Black Mass”—a subject that Cooper and the screenwriters, Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, anchor the film upon but hardly examine in any detail—is the local loyalty that binds residents of the neighborhood together and places their mutual allegiance ahead of other commitments, whether to morality or to law. The central plot point of the movie is the readiness of the F.B.I. agent John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), the “handler” of Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) when the gang lord became an informant, to cover for Bulger and to protect him from investigation by others within the bureau. The movie isn’t incidentally set in South Boston; it’s not placed there because the neighborhood is picturesque. Not only do the events take place there but the events seem to be conspicuously and inextricably influenced by the underlying and longstanding relationships of the neighborhood, its ethos.</p> <p>Some critics have expressed Boston-fatigue, taking the accent as a generic signifier for white ethnicity and urban grit. But it’s something more: Boston is the leading cinematic signifier of whiteness, of white ethnicity and ethnic solidarity outside the South and without the taint of white Southern revanchism. The South Boston setting is a prime marker of the extended family, the unified community where omertà is both a matter of prudence and of pride, where somehow organized crime can be seen as the community getting its due against the authorities and the privileged insiders (cited in the course of the film as “Cambridge”) who are prejudiced against them on the grounds of ethnicity (Irish), religion (Catholic), and class. The politicians are locals, the police are locals, the criminals are locals, and the neighborhood defends itself against outsiders—whether F.B.I. snoops or black interlopers, whether Italian gangsters or Harvard snoots.</p> <p>The film renders Whitey Bulger fascinating through his hypnotic intensity, his combination of attraction and fear, his Machiavellian intellectual clarity and focussed ruthlessness. Depp’s performance, even down to the burr of his voice, has the unrealized stuff of greatness—a control of gesture and gaze that could be the essence of character if it didn’t seem so much like a style of acting. Cooper’s camera, however, reveals nothing—it neither gets close enough to penetrate the mask nor far enough to capture the dance. “Black Mass” offers little insight into how Bulger lives, what he thinks, what (if anything) he feels. It also leaves Connolly’s motives and conflicts unexamined. It’s a movie that has neither psychological insight nor behavioral flair nor a unified aesthetic tone. Yet it does have a clear point of view, one that seems to pervade the film by default, and one that is largely responsible, I think, for the movie’s <a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/box-office/black-mass-boston-box-office-johnny-depp-1201597954/">commercial success</a>.</p> <p>“Black Mass” is peculiarly transparent regarding the very essence of the gangster film. The emotional impetus propelling the movie is the intrinsic fascination of crime and non-punishment, the terrifying allure of violent crime itself, like a real-life horror film. What Cooper expresses is dumbfounded wonder, sheer amazement that anyone could ever have done what Whitey Bulger and his crew did, and then have gotten away with it for as long as they did. It’s rooted in astonishment that Connolly could have shielding Bulger for decades, could have kept his F.B.I. colleagues and superiors at bay. This is all compounded by amazement at how William Bulger held such an esteemed insiders’ position at exactly the moment that James Bulger was engaged in schemes of such radical lawlessness, how the ranks of Southie oozed so staunchly around Bulger’s gang to insulate them from investigation and arrest.</p> <p>This gestalt—of crime, blunder, obliviousness, and heartiness—that formed around Whitey Bulger is depicted by Cooper as so unreal, so unbelievable, that he costumes and cosmeticizes and directs Bulger and his henchmen as grotesques. Even within their little world, they appear and act not merely as immoral monsters but as virtual aliens. The criminals are unshaven, lumpy, wart-faced, puffy; Johnny Depp, with his sharpened cheekbones, resembles <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gItZMA4wwcY/maxresdefault.jpg">Lon Chaney’s Phantom of the Opera</a>; whereas F.B.I. agents all appear like stars come to life, like smooth and glossy <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Efrem_Zimbalist_Jr._1971.JPG/165px-Efrem_Zimbalist_Jr._1971.JPG">Efrem Zimbalists</a>.</p> <p>Cooper seems appalled by Whitey Bulger’s deeds, admiring of his intelligence, terrified by his sangfroid—a perspective that’s more or less indistinguishable from that of the focus-group-tested average of viewers’ responses—and, above all, passively amazed at the way the world works, at the way that Bulger’s life turned out. The movie’s passive wonder is the core of its popularity. That’s why the historical distance of the movie, the flashback structure, is essential—the movie begins with the comforting perspective of order restored, offering the testimony of Bulger’s associates as a cushion for the horrors of the past.</p> <p>In the movie’s scale of emotional triggers, murder comes off in the list of monstrosities somewhere below racism—or, rather, Whitey Bulger’s crimes register so far off the charts as to become, in “Black Mass,” pure spectacle, pure sensation. It’s indicative of the sympathies to which Cooper caters—and that he seemingly shares—that a shrewd killer can be counted on to gain widespread empathy and exert diabolical fascination on an audience that no racist can. The difference between the Whitey Bulger case and the question of school desegregation is the difference between a matter resolved and an ongoing crisis. The political particulars and community-centered motives of the busing conflict, though historical, remain contemporary, uncushioned by time. For Cooper to have included them would have risked turning the screen into a mirror.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Scott Cooper’s film “Black Mass” is told in flashback, framed by recent confessions by James (Whitey) Bulger’s partners in crime, and the first of these flashbacks is dated, in an on-screen title, to 1975.

This is all compounded by amazement at how William Bulger held such an esteemed insiders’ position at exactly the moment that James Bulger was engaged in schemes of such radical lawlessness, how the ranks of Southie oozed so staunchly around Bulger’s gang to insulate them from investigation and arrest.</p> <p>This gestalt—of crime, blunder, obliviousness, and heartiness—that formed around Whitey Bulger is depicted by Cooper as so unreal, so unbelievable, that he costumes and cosmeticizes and directs Bulger and his henchmen as grotesques. Even within their little world, they appear and act not merely as immoral monsters but as virtual aliens. The criminals are unshaven, lumpy, wart-faced, puffy; Johnny Depp, with his sharpened cheekbones, resembles <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gItZMA4wwcY/maxresdefault.jpg">Lon Chaney’s Phantom of the Opera</a>; whereas F.B.I. agents all appear like stars come to life, like smooth and glossy <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Efrem_Zimbalist_Jr._1971.JPG/165px-Efrem_Zimbalist_Jr._1971.JPG">Efrem Zimbalists</a>.</p> <p>Cooper seems appalled by Whitey Bulger’s deeds, admiring of his intelligence, terrified by his sangfroid—a perspective that’s more or less indistinguishable from that of the focus-group-tested average of viewers’ responses—and, above all, passively amazed at the way the world works, at the way that Bulger’s life turned out. The movie’s passive wonder is the core of its popularity. That’s why the historical distance of the movie, the flashback structure, is essential—the movie begins with the comforting perspective of order restored, offering the testimony of Bulger’s associates as a cushion for the horrors of the past.</p> <p>In the movie’s scale of emotional triggers, murder comes off in the list of monstrosities somewhere below racism—or, rather, Whitey Bulger’s crimes register so far off the charts as to become, in “Black Mass,” pure spectacle, pure sensation. It’s indicative of the sympathies to which Cooper caters—and that he seemingly shares—that a shrewd killer can be counted on to gain widespread empathy and exert diabolical fascination on an audience that no racist can. The difference between the Whitey Bulger case and the question of school desegregation is the difference between a matter resolved and an ongoing crisis. The political particulars and community-centered motives of the busing conflict, though historical, remain contemporary, uncushioned by time. For Cooper to have included them would have risked turning the screen into a mirror.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”</p> <p>Modern readers will note a certain gender bias in phrases like “a man of 70,” “the right kind of young man,” and “virility,” and should know that these somewhat depressed observations came soon after the midterms, in which Democrats took control of the Senate and House, by majorities that the party would keep for decades. Eisenhower’s worries became far more intense several months later, in late September, 1955, when he suffered a major heart attack.</p> <p>This is a roundabout way of getting to the sensitive, impolite subject of when, if ever, a candidate might be too old for the Presidency. It is a question whose premise, in an era when the word “ageism” is embedded in the language, many are inclined to reject, in part because the motives for asking it tend to be suspect. The thuggish wing of the talk-radio community uses the age question to <a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2015/04/13/hannitys-sexist-ageist-attack-against-hillary-c/203267">undermine</a> Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who will be sixty-eight in October. That makes her more than a year younger than Donald Trump, although age is the least of many concerns about him. Age should certainly count a lot less than the goofy ideas and inexperience demonstrated by too many Republicans. But the curious absence of a new political generation should concern Democrats, and a party whose other poll-leading 2016 candidates, declared and not, are Bernie Sanders, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who will be seventy-three in November. (Barely registering in the polls are Jim Webb, who is sixty-nine, and Martin O’Malley, a relative teen at fifty-two.) Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee are in their early sixties, but, for better or worse, Republicans also have half a dozen contenders in their forties and fifties. The distinct problem for the Democrats isn’t the presence of elders; it’s the absence of young women and men with the potential to be credible national candidates.</p> <p>Apart from Ronald Reagan, who at sixty-nine was the oldest President ever to be elected, Americans have tended to choose younger men for the office. Franklin D. Roosevelt was fifty when he won his first term; John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama were in their forties. Even Eisenhower, grandfatherly affect and all, was only sixty-two when he won the White House for the first time.</p> <p>In the early winter of 1956, as the next Presidential cycle began and Eisenhower recovered from his heart attack, he wrote to his childhood friend Edward E. (Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”</p> <p>At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.</p> <p>The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p">vaccines may cause autism</a> (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition. That was an impulse rarely glimpsed in last week’s Republican debate.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>In November, 1954, Dwight D.

(Swede) Hazlett to say, “We all know that when advancing years and diminishing energy begin to take their toll, the last one that ever appreciates such a situation is the victim himself.” In another letter, to a doctor who’d recently examined him and thought that he was healthy enough to run again, Ike expressed still more doubts. In “contemplating my own future duty,” he compared his job to that of a quarterback: “He may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play…. If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the Presidency.”</p> <p>At the end of February, 1956, a month after sending that letter, Eisenhower announced that he would indeed seek a second term, though he planned to let Vice-President Richard Nixon do most of the campaigning. Ike went on to win reëlection in a landslide. But his health was shakier than his doctors were willing to say, and he suffered two more serious medical alarms—ileitis, an intestinal condition, in the summer of 1956, and a minor stroke, in the fall of 1957. In October, 1960, he marked his seventieth birthday, which, until the Reagan era, made him the oldest President ever to serve.</p> <p>The country fifty-five years ago was lucky that it all turned out as it did. It was also another reminder, just ten years after Roosevelt’s death, that choosing a Vice-President is a serious matter. During the 1956 campaign, the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, made an issue of Eisenhower’s health—and the possibility that Nixon, deeply hated by Democrats, might become President. Democrats, without a successor generation in clear view, may get lucky in 2016, especially facing a Republican field whose contenders include people who say, inexplicably, as they did in last week’s debate, that George W. Bush left the country safer (Jeb Bush), or that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-doctors-of-the-g-o-p">vaccines may cause autism</a> (Trump), or that it’s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood (Ted Cruz, Chris Christie). Sixty years ago, Eisenhower was willing to consider the nation’s welfare ahead of personal ambition. That was an impulse rarely glimpsed in last week’s Republican debate.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

 						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”</p>]]></description>

But in their intimate perspective the photographs emphasize the women’s shared experience—the inward focus and physical determination in their final, transformative moments of becoming mothers.</p> <p>If you look closely, though, you’ll see signs—the sterile white backgrounds in some photos and patterned fabric in others; a single acupuncture pin in the center of a forehead—that the women in Karlberg’s photographs are having drastically different experiences of giving birth. Half of the pictures were taken in Sweden and half in Tanzania. In the former country, almost all births take place in hospitals, where women have access to supportive midwives who are backed by sophisticated medical technology when needed.

In her home country, “The woman about to give birth is lying on the public hospital’s white sheets. . . . Next to her is her husband, stroking her back, talking to her supportively, helping her to focus on her breathing. Low music comes from the speakers. Water and juice is on the table next to the height-adjustable bed. The woman has her own room and her own bathroom with a tub. Painkillers are available upon request.” In Tanzania, “the woman about to give birth is lying on a bare, rusty bunk, covered in fabrics she brought with her. The water tap is not working, and even if it was, the water would not be drinkable. If she has to urinate there is a bucket on the floor. There is no family member by her side, but three other women, on similar bunks and in various stages of labor, share the room. As they moan, the nurses tell them to be quiet. Since there are no painkillers, the women need to save their strength for the pushing in the end.” As a result of these extreme disparities, and the corresponding difference in the ability to deal with medical complications, the risk of dying during childbirth in Tanzania is a hundred times higher than it is in Sweden.</p> <p>But despite this cross-national chasm in maternal health, simple explanations of the West-as-best and modernization-as-cure are insufficient. As Karlberg hints in the photo shown in the final slide above—a woman originally from Uganda, giving birth in Sweden—Sweden has experienced a wave of immigrants over the past four decades, many of them refugees from conflict-torn places like Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia, and now Syria. Though Sweden has proved <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/sweden-offers-shelter-denmark-tries-discourage-refugees/">more welcoming than other European nations</a> in the current refugee crisis, the country’s government—influenced by the far-right Swedish Democrats, who received support from one out of every eight voters in the 2014 parliamentary elections—has grown more nativist and stingy about its welfare state. In Tanzania, meanwhile, maternal-mortality rates have improved slightly in recent years as the country has experienced impressive economic growth and extensive foreign aid, but the rates today are the same as they were sixty years ago.

The event began <small>BAM</small>’s Ingrid Bergman centenary film festival, which continues through Saturday. It rounds up the usual suspects— “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vThuwa5RZU">Casablanca</a>,”&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8f4UOtLf5Q">Notorious</a>,”&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLfQU2xmg">Gaslight</a>”&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBaGIUbXqI">Spellbound</a>”—along with early Swedish dramas; two of the films Bergman made with Isabella’s father, Roberto Rossellini,&nbsp;“<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-europa-51">Europa ’51</a>”&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-voyage-to-italy">“Journey to Italy</a>”; Ingmar Bergman’s “Autumn Sonata”; “Murder on the Orient Express,” for which she won her third Oscar; and others. Before an afternoon rehearsal for the tribute, Rossellini, sitting on a couch in the elegant green room at BAM, talked about her impulse to preserve her parents’ work. “Does it have to be preserved?” she asked. “I remember talking to Bernardo Bertolucci, and he said, ‘I believe in the mandala, I believe I’m a little bit of a Buddhist. I believe that things are impermanent.’ ” Rossellini’s accent—as many of us have observed over the years, in everything from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHFk0Asaxuo">Blue Velvet</a>” to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve31XhpaPRU">30 Rock</a>” to “<a href="http://www.sundance.tv/series/green-porno/videos/praying-mantis-green-porno-season-1">Green Porno</a>”— is like her mother’s, with a little something extra. “And then I speak to Martin Scorsese, with whom I was married, and he says, ‘Rock and roll and films—this is the culture that has characterized our century the most.’ We have to preserve all of it.”</p> <p>In 2006, Rossellini made a comic, affectionate short film called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hMdNihop3c">“My Dad Is 100 Years Old</a>,”&nbsp;directed by Guy Maddin. In it, she performed the roles of Fellini, Hitchcock, David O. Selznick, Charlie Chaplin, herself, her mother, and her father’s voice. The rest of her father was played by a belly. “Some of my family were offended by ‘My Dad Is 100 Years Old,’ because it was a surrealist film, and I portrayed my father as a belly,” she said. “To me it was like a Buddha belly or a pregnant belly, because he was fat. Most of my films are comical. But some members of my family found it was disrespectful. So this time around, I said, I’m going more traditional.”</p> <p>Rossellini enlisted the help of Guido Torlonia and Ludovica Damiani, whose appreciations of Fellini and Visconti she had seen in Italy. “They had two actors, a woman and a man, reading from theatre reviews, a piece of a letter. There were photos, clips, even newsreels, which we also have tonight, so you also know where is it placed, their life, what kind of history is happening. And I thought it was so pleasant—in an hour and a half, you really have a portrait of the person, the time, and the reaction to the person. Since I didn’t want to write my own thing, because it always comes out a little bit surreal and comical—that seems to be my voice as a writer—I said, Let’s just use her autobiography.”</p> <p>In the nineteen-forties, Bergman was one of the best known and most beloved movie stars in the world. Her affair with Roberto Rossellini, in 1949, caused a scandal that threatened to overshadow her reputation as an actor. Rossellini told me that with the tribute, “What I wanted to say about my mom is that my mom was an artist, and for her it was an urgency. If she didn’t act, she was not happy. How this came about, I don’t know. If you want to be like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.peanuts.com/characters/lucy/#.VgChpnub51Q">Lucy</a>, five-cents psychiatrist, you could say, ‘She was an orphan, it was only when she entered dramatic school that she found happiness again, and from then on she was hooked.’ But I think life’s more complicated than that. I think sometimes she regretted it—she wanted to be a more present mother or a more present wife. When she wrote her autobiography—which she did for us, and I’m very grateful, because I consult that book a lot—I could see that she wrote so she could justify, she could tell her story. There is an emphasis on trying to explain. But in fact, what people remember her for is her art. Which is the one thing she wanted.”</p> <p>In the show that night, with nearly hundred-year-old photographs of Bergman onscreen behind her, Rossellini read Bergman’s description of herself as a child: “As a little girl, I was always being something else: a bird, or a lamppost, a policeman, a postman, a flower pot. I remember the day I decided to be a small dog. I was quite disconcerted when my father refused absolutely to put a leash around my neck and take me for a walk…. I still trotted at his heels woofing at all the passersby and cocking my leg up against every tree we passed.”</p> <p>The performance led the audience through Bergman’s story, with Rossellini and Irons alternating readings of Bergman’s memoir, along with letters. Glorious photographs, home movies, and film clips, from Sweden, Hollywood, Italy, and beyond, showed onscreen above them. The show revealed what Rossellini intended it to: Bergman’s playfulness, joyfulness, experimentalism, naturalism.</p> <p>Bergman went to drama school at age twelve, after her father’s death, and as a young woman she began acting in Swedish films. The director Gustaf Molander taught her, she wrote, “how to underplay, to be absolutely sincere and natural: ‘Never try to be cute. Always be yourself.’ ” When she came to Hollywood, when David O. Selznick decided to remake her Swedish hit “Intermezzo,” he wanted her to change her name—too German, too hard to pronounce—and she refused. In the performance, Jeremy Irons read, “Selznick looked fumbled and then said, ‘I’ve got an idea! It is a simple idea yet none in Hollywood has even tried it before. Nothing about you is going to be touched. Nothing altered. You will remain yourself. Ingrid Bergman is going to be the first natural actress!’ ” She relished challenging roles, such as a burn victim in the Swedish melodrama “<a href="http://www.bam.org/film/2015/a-womans-face">A Woman’s Face</a>”;&nbsp;in Hollywood, during the filming of “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” she asked the director, Victor Fleming, if she could switch roles with Lana Turner: “I wanted to play the little tart in the bar, the naughty little Ivy.” And she did.</p> <p>The audience clapped spontaneously when clips of “Casablanca” were shown—the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vThuwa5RZU">Play it, Sam</a>” scene and the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEWaqUVac3M">hill of beans</a>” scene. The world remembers “Casablanca” more fondly than Bergman did. During filming, she wrote, Humphrey Bogart was grouchy and distant, and the production was chaotic. Rossellini read, “When I asked who I was supposed to be in love with, Paul Henreid, who played my husband, or Humphrey Bogart, who played my lover, Curtiz told me: ‘We don’t know yet. Just play it … well … in between.’ ”</p> <p>Bergman’s zest and merriment came through in the descriptions of the making of “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” “Gaslight,” “Spellbound,” and “Notorious”; she became good friends with Hemingway, Alfred Hitchcock and his wife, and Jean Renoir and his wife. Rossellini read her mother’s description of Hitchcock’s intimate dinner parties: “ ‘More than eight people around the table is an insult to friendship,’ he would say. Hitch, because I could drink a lot and never get sick, awarded me with the honorary title of the ‘human sink.’ ” A charming late clip played, of Bergman saluting Hitchcock at his AFI Life Achievement award, in which she calls him a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKpuunhqWk4">gentleman farmer who raises gooseflesh</a>.”</p> <p>In 1947, Bergman began filming “Joan of Arc,” directed by Fleming. Rossellini read, “Like all the motion pictures done in Hollywood at the time, everything was shot in the studio: the battle scenes, the towers of Chinon, and the French villages were painted backdrops.” Onstage, Bergman’s own behind-the-scenes footage, shot on 16-mm. film, played above Rossellini and Irons. Rossellini read, “I wanted to get out into the world; I wanted to be where the real people were. I was seeking the truth.” One night, Bergman saw Roberto Rossellini’s 1945 neorealist masterpiece “Open City,” about Rome during Nazi occupation. “The realism and simplicity of the film was heart shocking,” Bergman wrote. “No one looked like an actor, no one talked like an actor.”</p> <p>Bergman wrote Rossellini a letter: “If you need a Swedish actress who speaks English very well, who has not forgotten her German, who is not very understandable in French, and who in Italian knows only ‘<em>ti amo</em>,’ I am ready to come and make a film with you.” Rossellini didn’t know Bergman. Jeremy Irons read, “Well, who is this Ingrid Bergman? Wait a minute … ‘Intermezzo’? That Swedish film.” He had seen it during a bombing raid. “I ran into the nearest place to shelter—a cinema. What better place to lose one’s life than in a comfortable seat in a cinema?” He had sat through it three times: “It was a very long bombing raid.” He accepted her offer with enthusiasm.</p> <p>In the green room, Rossellini said to me, “My father is trying to figure out, how do you integrate a big Swede that doesn’t speak Italian, blond, blue eyes?” He was a neorealist director, and his style, not to mention Bergman’s, required naturalism. “So one day he is travelling outside of Rome, and he sees a refugee camp. And he writes to my mother, ‘I saw this refugee camp, this field with these women looking like lambs, just walking around. One was a little bit separated from the others, and she was gesticulating to me…. I had the feeling that she was trying to seduce me.’ This is the beginning of ‘Stromboli.’ A woman that does not want to go back to Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, a country that was completely devastated by the war. Her only chance is to seduce an Italian to stay. She happens to go to Stromboli, a primitive island, this incredible cultural clash.”</p> <p>Bergman and Rossellini, who were both married, with children, fell in love on the set of “Stromboli.” In the performance that night, Rossellini read, “As soon as we got to the island of Stromboli, a small volcanic island north of Sicily, and began to film, everyone realized that Roberto and I spent more time together than was necessary just to shoot a movie.… The Italian press, scenting&nbsp;<em>amore</em>&nbsp;as sharks scent blood, were already dispatching to the island reporters disguised as fishermen, as tourists. On one occasion one came as a monk.” Bergman, who had played a nun and a saint, became pregnant with their son, scandalizing the world. In the U.S., she was condemned as a “powerful force for evil” on the Senate floor. Bergman and Rossellini divorced their spouses, married, and had two more children: Isabella and her twin sister, Ingrid. They made five films together.</p> <p>Rossellini said to me, “A lot of people have asked me, ‘Was she an early feminist?’ She was an artist. She had to do what she had to do. It happened that she did it at a time in which women’s roles were changing. She was punished for her independence. It was society that wasn’t feminist.”</p> <p>With Rossellini, Bergman made great art; the commercial world didn’t know how to respond to it, but,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2907-living-in-cinema-rossellini-and-bergman-in-italy">as Richard Brody has written</a>, the films, in particular “Journey to Italy,” helped to inspire the French New Wave.</p> <p>Over the years, Bergman wrote, “I started to feel resentful of Roberto’s jealousy and possessiveness. He wouldn’t let me work with any other director”—not Zeffirelli, Fellini, Visconti, or De Sica. “It was my old friend Jean Renoir who rescued me,” she wrote. Renoir visited the couple, offered Bergman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDv_rG009Gc">a role in a film</a>, and encouraged Rossellini to shoot a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrFsyWXlugM">documentary</a> in India. “He came back from India with his documentary and a pregnant Indian woman. I felt a smile spreading on my face from ear to ear. I was so relieved. For him and for me. Now we had solved it.”</p> <p>After they divorced, Bergman married a Swedish theatre producer, Lars Schmidt. In home movies shown during the performance, Bergman, her four children, and Schmidt frolicked in full-color midsummer joy on Schmidt’s remote Swedish island. Bergman made many other films, including “Anastasia,” a television production of “Hedda Gabler,” “Cactus Flower,” with Goldie Hawn, “Murder on the Orient Express,” “Autumn Sonata,” and “A Woman Called Golda,” in which she played Golda Meir. At the end of the show, Rossellini read, “There is something so dramatic, nostalgic, and heartbreaking about the end of a run of a play or a film shoot. We had been a wonderfully friendly and tightly knit company. Then of course it comes to an end.” You have a party, “you go from dressing room to dressing room and everybody’s kissing everybody else, and everybody is in tears. It’s such desperation when you leave. It’s divorce from the people you have learnt to love, and you say: shall we ever meet again?”</p> <p>In the green room, Rossellini told me that Jean Renoir had written a book that she’d read with interest: “the most beautiful book on his father, Auguste Renoir, the painter,” she said. “Jean Renoir was a soldier when he was eighteen, in World War I, and he was wounded. When Jean got wounded the father became crazy with worry, you know, and so he took Jean into his studio, always under his watch, so he could paint. He would speak to Jean about art and what he was trying to do. It’s the most incredible portrait of an artist. And there’s one thing that Jean says: ‘I have to paint. It’s like peeing. I cannot not do it.’ ” She laughed. “I always loved that. It made me understand the urgency that artists feel. You know?

The event began <small>BAM</small>’s Ingrid Bergman centenary film festival, which continues through Saturday. It rounds up the usual suspects— “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vThuwa5RZU">Casablanca</a>,”&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8f4UOtLf5Q">Notorious</a>,”&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLfQU2xmg">Gaslight</a>”&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBaGIUbXqI">Spellbound</a>”—along with early Swedish dramas; two of the films Bergman made with Isabella’s father, Roberto Rossellini,&nbsp;“<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-europa-51">Europa ’51</a>”&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-voyage-to-italy">“Journey to Italy</a>”; Ingmar Bergman’s “Autumn Sonata”; “Murder on the Orient Express,” for which she won her third Oscar; and others. Before an afternoon rehearsal for the tribute, Rossellini, sitting on a couch in the elegant green room at BAM, talked about her impulse to preserve her parents’ work. “Does it have to be preserved?” she asked. “I remember talking to Bernardo Bertolucci, and he said, ‘I believe in the mandala, I believe I’m a little bit of a Buddhist. I believe that things are impermanent.’ ” Rossellini’s accent—as many of us have observed over the years, in everything from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHFk0Asaxuo">Blue Velvet</a>” to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve31XhpaPRU">30 Rock</a>” to “<a href="http://www.sundance.tv/series/green-porno/videos/praying-mantis-green-porno-season-1">Green Porno</a>”— is like her mother’s, with a little something extra. “And then I speak to Martin Scorsese, with whom I was married, and he says, ‘Rock and roll and films—this is the culture that has characterized our century the most.’ We have to preserve all of it.”</p> <p>In 2006, Rossellini made a comic, affectionate short film called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hMdNihop3c">“My Dad Is 100 Years Old</a>,”&nbsp;directed by Guy Maddin. In it, she performed the roles of Fellini, Hitchcock, David O. Selznick, Charlie Chaplin, herself, her mother, and her father’s voice. The rest of her father was played by a belly. “Some of my family were offended by ‘My Dad Is 100 Years Old,’ because it was a surrealist film, and I portrayed my father as a belly,” she said. “To me it was like a Buddha belly or a pregnant belly, because he was fat. Most of my films are comical. But some members of my family found it was disrespectful. So this time around, I said, I’m going more traditional.”</p> <p>Rossellini enlisted the help of Guido Torlonia and Ludovica Damiani, whose appreciations of Fellini and Visconti she had seen in Italy. “They had two actors, a woman and a man, reading from theatre reviews, a piece of a letter. There were photos, clips, even newsreels, which we also have tonight, so you also know where is it placed, their life, what kind of history is happening. And I thought it was so pleasant—in an hour and a half, you really have a portrait of the person, the time, and the reaction to the person. Since I didn’t want to write my own thing, because it always comes out a little bit surreal and comical—that seems to be my voice as a writer—I said, Let’s just use her autobiography.”</p> <p>In the nineteen-forties, Bergman was one of the best known and most beloved movie stars in the world. Her affair with Roberto Rossellini, in 1949, caused a scandal that threatened to overshadow her reputation as an actor. Rossellini told me that with the tribute, “What I wanted to say about my mom is that my mom was an artist, and for her it was an urgency. If she didn’t act, she was not happy. How this came about, I don’t know. If you want to be like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.peanuts.com/characters/lucy/#.VgChpnub51Q">Lucy</a>, five-cents psychiatrist, you could say, ‘She was an orphan, it was only when she entered dramatic school that she found happiness again, and from then on she was hooked.’ But I think life’s more complicated than that. I think sometimes she regretted it—she wanted to be a more present mother or a more present wife. When she wrote her autobiography—which she did for us, and I’m very grateful, because I consult that book a lot—I could see that she wrote so she could justify, she could tell her story. There is an emphasis on trying to explain. But in fact, what people remember her for is her art. Which is the one thing she wanted.”</p> <p>In the show that night, with nearly hundred-year-old photographs of Bergman onscreen behind her, Rossellini read Bergman’s description of herself as a child: “As a little girl, I was always being something else: a bird, or a lamppost, a policeman, a postman, a flower pot. I remember the day I decided to be a small dog. I was quite disconcerted when my father refused absolutely to put a leash around my neck and take me for a walk…. I still trotted at his heels woofing at all the passersby and cocking my leg up against every tree we passed.”</p> <p>The performance led the audience through Bergman’s story, with Rossellini and Irons alternating readings of Bergman’s memoir, along with letters. Glorious photographs, home movies, and film clips, from Sweden, Hollywood, Italy, and beyond, showed onscreen above them. The show revealed what Rossellini intended it to: Bergman’s playfulness, joyfulness, experimentalism, naturalism.</p> <p>Bergman went to drama school at age twelve, after her father’s death, and as a young woman she began acting in Swedish films. The director Gustaf Molander taught her, she wrote, “how to underplay, to be absolutely sincere and natural: ‘Never try to be cute. Always be yourself.’ ” When she came to Hollywood, when David O. Selznick decided to remake her Swedish hit “Intermezzo,” he wanted her to change her name—too German, too hard to pronounce—and she refused. In the performance, Jeremy Irons read, “Selznick looked fumbled and then said, ‘I’ve got an idea! It is a simple idea yet none in Hollywood has even tried it before. Nothing about you is going to be touched. Nothing altered. You will remain yourself. Ingrid Bergman is going to be the first natural actress!’ ” She relished challenging roles, such as a burn victim in the Swedish melodrama “<a href="http://www.bam.org/film/2015/a-womans-face">A Woman’s Face</a>”;&nbsp;in Hollywood, during the filming of “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” she asked the director, Victor Fleming, if she could switch roles with Lana Turner: “I wanted to play the little tart in the bar, the naughty little Ivy.” And she did.</p> <p>The audience clapped spontaneously when clips of “Casablanca” were shown—the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vThuwa5RZU">Play it, Sam</a>” scene and the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEWaqUVac3M">hill of beans</a>” scene. The world remembers “Casablanca” more fondly than Bergman did. During filming, she wrote, Humphrey Bogart was grouchy and distant, and the production was chaotic. Rossellini read, “When I asked who I was supposed to be in love with, Paul Henreid, who played my husband, or Humphrey Bogart, who played my lover, Curtiz told me: ‘We don’t know yet. Just play it … well … in between.’ ”</p> <p>Bergman’s zest and merriment came through in the descriptions of the making of “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” “Gaslight,” “Spellbound,” and “Notorious”; she became good friends with Hemingway, Alfred Hitchcock and his wife, and Jean Renoir and his wife. Rossellini read her mother’s description of Hitchcock’s intimate dinner parties: “ ‘More than eight people around the table is an insult to friendship,’ he would say. Hitch, because I could drink a lot and never get sick, awarded me with the honorary title of the ‘human sink.’ ” A charming late clip played, of Bergman saluting Hitchcock at his AFI Life Achievement award, in which she calls him a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKpuunhqWk4">gentleman farmer who raises gooseflesh</a>.”</p> <p>In 1947, Bergman began filming “Joan of Arc,” directed by Fleming. Rossellini read, “Like all the motion pictures done in Hollywood at the time, everything was shot in the studio: the battle scenes, the towers of Chinon, and the French villages were painted backdrops.” Onstage, Bergman’s own behind-the-scenes footage, shot on 16-mm. film, played above Rossellini and Irons. Rossellini read, “I wanted to get out into the world; I wanted to be where the real people were. I was seeking the truth.” One night, Bergman saw Roberto Rossellini’s 1945 neorealist masterpiece “Open City,” about Rome during Nazi occupation. “The realism and simplicity of the film was heart shocking,” Bergman wrote. “No one looked like an actor, no one talked like an actor.”</p> <p>Bergman wrote Rossellini a letter: “If you need a Swedish actress who speaks English very well, who has not forgotten her German, who is not very understandable in French, and who in Italian knows only ‘<em>ti amo</em>,’ I am ready to come and make a film with you.” Rossellini didn’t know Bergman. Jeremy Irons read, “Well, who is this Ingrid Bergman? Wait a minute … ‘Intermezzo’? That Swedish film.” He had seen it during a bombing raid. “I ran into the nearest place to shelter—a cinema. What better place to lose one’s life than in a comfortable seat in a cinema?” He had sat through it three times: “It was a very long bombing raid.” He accepted her offer with enthusiasm.</p> <p>In the green room, Rossellini said to me, “My father is trying to figure out, how do you integrate a big Swede that doesn’t speak Italian, blond, blue eyes?” He was a neorealist director, and his style, not to mention Bergman’s, required naturalism. “So one day he is travelling outside of Rome, and he sees a refugee camp. And he writes to my mother, ‘I saw this refugee camp, this field with these women looking like lambs, just walking around. One was a little bit separated from the others, and she was gesticulating to me…. I had the feeling that she was trying to seduce me.’ This is the beginning of ‘Stromboli.’ A woman that does not want to go back to Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, a country that was completely devastated by the war. Her only chance is to seduce an Italian to stay. She happens to go to Stromboli, a primitive island, this incredible cultural clash.”</p> <p>Bergman and Rossellini, who were both married, with children, fell in love on the set of “Stromboli.” In the performance that night, Rossellini read, “As soon as we got to the island of Stromboli, a small volcanic island north of Sicily, and began to film, everyone realized that Roberto and I spent more time together than was necessary just to shoot a movie.… The Italian press, scenting&nbsp;<em>amore</em>&nbsp;as sharks scent blood, were already dispatching to the island reporters disguised as fishermen, as tourists. On one occasion one came as a monk.” Bergman, who had played a nun and a saint, became pregnant with their son, scandalizing the world. In the U.S., she was condemned as a “powerful force for evil” on the Senate floor. Bergman and Rossellini divorced their spouses, married, and had two more children: Isabella and her twin sister, Ingrid. They made five films together.</p> <p>Rossellini said to me, “A lot of people have asked me, ‘Was she an early feminist?’ She was an artist. She had to do what she had to do. It happened that she did it at a time in which women’s roles were changing. She was punished for her independence. It was society that wasn’t feminist.”</p> <p>With Rossellini, Bergman made great art; the commercial world didn’t know how to respond to it, but,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2907-living-in-cinema-rossellini-and-bergman-in-italy">as Richard Brody has written</a>, the films, in particular “Journey to Italy,” helped to inspire the French New Wave.</p> <p>Over the years, Bergman wrote, “I started to feel resentful of Roberto’s jealousy and possessiveness. He wouldn’t let me work with any other director”—not Zeffirelli, Fellini, Visconti, or De Sica. “It was my old friend Jean Renoir who rescued me,” she wrote. Renoir visited the couple, offered Bergman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDv_rG009Gc">a role in a film</a>, and encouraged Rossellini to shoot a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrFsyWXlugM">documentary</a> in India. “He came back from India with his documentary and a pregnant Indian woman. I felt a smile spreading on my face from ear to ear. I was so relieved. For him and for me. Now we had solved it.”</p> <p>After they divorced, Bergman married a Swedish theatre producer, Lars Schmidt. In home movies shown during the performance, Bergman, her four children, and Schmidt frolicked in full-color midsummer joy on Schmidt’s remote Swedish island. Bergman made many other films, including “Anastasia,” a television production of “Hedda Gabler,” “Cactus Flower,” with Goldie Hawn, “Murder on the Orient Express,” “Autumn Sonata,” and “A Woman Called Golda,” in which she played Golda Meir. At the end of the show, Rossellini read, “There is something so dramatic, nostalgic, and heartbreaking about the end of a run of a play or a film shoot. We had been a wonderfully friendly and tightly knit company. Then of course it comes to an end.” You have a party, “you go from dressing room to dressing room and everybody’s kissing everybody else, and everybody is in tears. It’s such desperation when you leave. It’s divorce from the people you have learnt to love, and you say: shall we ever meet again?”</p> <p>In the green room, Rossellini told me that Jean Renoir had written a book that she’d read with interest: “the most beautiful book on his father, Auguste Renoir, the painter,” she said. “Jean Renoir was a soldier when he was eighteen, in World War I, and he was wounded.

Attendees from brands like Nabisco and Chipotle, and from government agencies like the U.S.D.A., might learn to map the chemical flavor profile of apple juice in order to identify abnormalities by smell. They might create a vocabulary for the scent, sight, texture, and taste of toast, to create a common language with which to evaluate baked goods. And they might design a taste test to determine whether chocolate-chip-cookie consumers really prefer more chips per bite, or just like seeing the words “extra chocolate” on a label.</p> <p>These techniques, and many more like them, form the basis of a field known as sensory analysis, a scientific approach to tasting food that is most often used by quality-control and product-development types from corporations with budgets for extensive research and development. The skills of the field are meant to help a company like Coca-Cola save five billion dollars on a dud like New Coke, or to help a potato-chip brand launch a best-selling flavor without having to test multiple versions in stores.</p> <p>But the methods of the discipline are becoming increasingly more appealing to small-batch food experts, too—specifically, the baristas, sommeliers, brewers, and chocolatiers whose jobs involve understanding and discussing subtle variations within a single food product. It’s not unheard of today to find a chocolate maker who offers customers a flavor wheel to explain the tastes found in his truffles, a mixologist who trains her palate to recognize a “library” of ingredients, or a sommelier who describes a wine’s flavor based on its <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-better-way-to-talk-about-wine">underlying chemical compounds</a>. These techniques, borrowed from the sensory analyst’s toolbox, are meant to put hard data behind the seemingly subjective question of how we perceive what we eat and drink.</p> <p>On a recent Saturday, I witnessed some of these tools being applied, at an all-day cheese-tasting workshop run by Montserrat Almena-Aliste, a Spanish-born cheese technologist and sensory-analysis consultant based in Vermont. The class was held in a wood-panelled event space at Larkin Cold Storage, a Queens specialty business run by Adam Moskowitz, who is known in the industry for extra-curricular activities like the annual <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-big-cheese">Cheesemonger Invitational competition</a>. In attendance were a group of mongers, buyers, makers, distributors, and wholesalers from specialty outfits like Murray’s Cheese, Essex Street Cheese Co., and Philadelphia’s Di Bruno Bros. “If you want to get really, really geeky about your senses and cheese,” Moskowitz told the group, “then this is for you.”</p> <p>Our first assignment was to learn how to “calibrate” our taste buds. Just as an orchestra gets in tune before each performance, professionals who are evaluating a food product should get on the same page with their terms. What, for example, qualifies as “salty” in a particular kind of cheese? What qualifies as “sweet”?</p> <p>To answer those questions, Almena-Aliste, a slender brunette who goes by Montse, had prepared nine samples of ricotta cheese, each mixed with a single ingredient to make it sweet, salty, sour, bitter, or umami. The ricottas, she explained, were meant to reflect the flavor levels of an Alpine cheese, like Gruyere or Appenzeller: the sample labelled “Sweet 1”—which tasted just barely sweet, much the way fresh whole milk might—was a little bit sweet for Gruyere, but would not be very sweet at all on a scale meant for a chocolate bar; the sample labelled “Salty 2” was a lot salty for Gruyere, but less salty than French fries.</p> <p>Almena-Aliste explained that our experiences of each sample would vary according to the sensitivity of our tongues. (“Bitter 2 almost made me throw up,” Moskowitz said.) But, like musicians who can identify when a note is a little sharp or flat, cheesemakers and mongers who can recognize appropriate flavor levels are better equipped to improve their products or flag flawed ones. “Can anyone tell me a defect that makes a cheese taste sweet?” Almena-Aliste asked. Students yelled them out: Milk solids. pH levels. Starter yeasts. The tasting exercise had allowed them to connect this more technical knowledge of cheesemaking to information delivered by their taste buds.</p> <p>In the course of the day, Almena-Aliste, who earned a doctorate at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, in Poligny, and who now teaches cheesemaking at Vermont Technical College, talked us through a host of other cheese attributes related not just to taste but to appearance and texture. We tested the firmness of a Gruyere by gently crushing samples between our rear molars, and inspected the exterior molds of a bloomy-rind goat cheese to make sure it conformed to stylistic standards. We discussed attributes like deformability, friability, and adhesibility (does the cheese break into particles when you press it, or simply compress?), and worried over “trigeminal sensations,” the feeling we get in the back of our throats when chile peppers, tannins in red wine, or a piece of provolone piccante tickle the trigeminal nerve.</p> <p>The most fun exercise—and the most useful one for an ordinary cheese lover—was the lesson on aromas. Almena-Aliste had brought twenty-seven unlabelled green plastic vials filled with various foods whose aromas are similar to the ones found in cheeses: boiled broccoli, a blob of butter, roast beef, over-cooked egg, bell peppers, pineapple, black pepper, hay. On the screen behind her was a rainbow-colored cheese-tasting wheel, whose spokes represented the eight major aroma families of cheese: lactic, vegetable, floral, fruity, toasted, animal, spice, and “others.” Students passed around the vials and took deep whiffs, then guessed what was inside each one. Was that vanilla custard followed by boiled chicken and carob, like I imagined? It turned out to be butter, cooked potatoes, and dried cranberries. The activity felt a little like a first visit to a fitness trainer, but for the nose—a slog through a few exercises, only to be confronted by the realization of how far you really have to go.</p> <p>Our guesses were not meant to prove who could identify scents correctly, however, but to show us that the only way to distinguish the aromas of, say, leather and meat broth is to actually smell them both. Specialty-food purveyors may not need to reformulate a diet soda with a billion-dollar market share, or choose the best lab-devised chip flavors to roll out in thousands of stores. But scientific tasting techniques are as well-suited, in a way, to the obsessions of today’s artisanal food world. “I do think deeply about cheese, but I have never had a toolbox before—it’s kind of overwhelming,” Moskowitz said when the class was coming to an end. Through calibrated palates and aromatic crib sheets, sensory experts like Almena-Aliste are forging a new shared language of connoisseurship.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Each September, emissaries from some of the nation’s biggest food companies gather at Rutgers University’s New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, in New Brunswick, for a two-day crash course aimed at helping them decode the science of human taste.

The skills of the field are meant to help a company like Coca-Cola save five billion dollars on a dud like New Coke, or to help a potato-chip brand launch a best-selling flavor without having to test multiple versions in stores.</p> <p>But the methods of the discipline are becoming increasingly more appealing to small-batch food experts, too—specifically, the baristas, sommeliers, brewers, and chocolatiers whose jobs involve understanding and discussing subtle variations within a single food product. It’s not unheard of today to find a chocolate maker who offers customers a flavor wheel to explain the tastes found in his truffles, a mixologist who trains her palate to recognize a “library” of ingredients, or a sommelier who describes a wine’s flavor based on its <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/is-there-a-better-way-to-talk-about-wine">underlying chemical compounds</a>. These techniques, borrowed from the sensory analyst’s toolbox, are meant to put hard data behind the seemingly subjective question of how we perceive what we eat and drink.</p> <p>On a recent Saturday, I witnessed some of these tools being applied, at an all-day cheese-tasting workshop run by Montserrat Almena-Aliste, a Spanish-born cheese technologist and sensory-analysis consultant based in Vermont. The class was held in a wood-panelled event space at Larkin Cold Storage, a Queens specialty business run by Adam Moskowitz, who is known in the industry for extra-curricular activities like the annual <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-big-cheese">Cheesemonger Invitational competition</a>. In attendance were a group of mongers, buyers, makers, distributors, and wholesalers from specialty outfits like Murray’s Cheese, Essex Street Cheese Co., and Philadelphia’s Di Bruno Bros. “If you want to get really, really geeky about your senses and cheese,” Moskowitz told the group, “then this is for you.”</p> <p>Our first assignment was to learn how to “calibrate” our taste buds. Just as an orchestra gets in tune before each performance, professionals who are evaluating a food product should get on the same page with their terms. What, for example, qualifies as “salty” in a particular kind of cheese? What qualifies as “sweet”?</p> <p>To answer those questions, Almena-Aliste, a slender brunette who goes by Montse, had prepared nine samples of ricotta cheese, each mixed with a single ingredient to make it sweet, salty, sour, bitter, or umami. The ricottas, she explained, were meant to reflect the flavor levels of an Alpine cheese, like Gruyere or Appenzeller: the sample labelled “Sweet 1”—which tasted just barely sweet, much the way fresh whole milk might—was a little bit sweet for Gruyere, but would not be very sweet at all on a scale meant for a chocolate bar; the sample labelled “Salty 2” was a lot salty for Gruyere, but less salty than French fries.</p> <p>Almena-Aliste explained that our experiences of each sample would vary according to the sensitivity of our tongues. (“Bitter 2 almost made me throw up,” Moskowitz said.) But, like musicians who can identify when a note is a little sharp or flat, cheesemakers and mongers who can recognize appropriate flavor levels are better equipped to improve their products or flag flawed ones. “Can anyone tell me a defect that makes a cheese taste sweet?” Almena-Aliste asked. Students yelled them out: Milk solids. pH levels. Starter yeasts. The tasting exercise had allowed them to connect this more technical knowledge of cheesemaking to information delivered by their taste buds.</p> <p>In the course of the day, Almena-Aliste, who earned a doctorate at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, in Poligny, and who now teaches cheesemaking at Vermont Technical College, talked us through a host of other cheese attributes related not just to taste but to appearance and texture. We tested the firmness of a Gruyere by gently crushing samples between our rear molars, and inspected the exterior molds of a bloomy-rind goat cheese to make sure it conformed to stylistic standards. We discussed attributes like deformability, friability, and adhesibility (does the cheese break into particles when you press it, or simply compress?), and worried over “trigeminal sensations,” the feeling we get in the back of our throats when chile peppers, tannins in red wine, or a piece of provolone piccante tickle the trigeminal nerve.</p> <p>The most fun exercise—and the most useful one for an ordinary cheese lover—was the lesson on aromas. Almena-Aliste had brought twenty-seven unlabelled green plastic vials filled with various foods whose aromas are similar to the ones found in cheeses: boiled broccoli, a blob of butter, roast beef, over-cooked egg, bell peppers, pineapple, black pepper, hay. On the screen behind her was a rainbow-colored cheese-tasting wheel, whose spokes represented the eight major aroma families of cheese: lactic, vegetable, floral, fruity, toasted, animal, spice, and “others.” Students passed around the vials and took deep whiffs, then guessed what was inside each one. Was that vanilla custard followed by boiled chicken and carob, like I imagined? It turned out to be butter, cooked potatoes, and dried cranberries. The activity felt a little like a first visit to a fitness trainer, but for the nose—a slog through a few exercises, only to be confronted by the realization of how far you really have to go.</p> <p>Our guesses were not meant to prove who could identify scents correctly, however, but to show us that the only way to distinguish the aromas of, say, leather and meat broth is to actually smell them both. Specialty-food purveyors may not need to reformulate a diet soda with a billion-dollar market share, or choose the best lab-devised chip flavors to roll out in thousands of stores. But scientific tasting techniques are as well-suited, in a way, to the obsessions of today’s artisanal food world. “I do think deeply about cheese, but I have never had a toolbox before—it’s kind of overwhelming,” Moskowitz said when the class was coming to an end. Through calibrated palates and aromatic crib sheets, sensory experts like Almena-Aliste are forging a new shared language of connoisseurship.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

Those all-or-nothing days in Cuba have gone, along with the passing from the scene of the revolution’s historic leader, Fidel Castro, who stepped down in 2008.* His brother, Raúl, has introduced a new political syncretism that has leapt over old shibboleths and embraced change without reconciling the past with the present.

He was standing on a lawn just north of the Capitol, addressing a crowd of several hundred supporters, some of whom, the previous afternoon, had completed a forty-six-day, thousand-mile march from Selma, Alabama, in support of voting rights. America’s Journey for Justice, as the march was called, had traversed five states. Each of them, Brooks had said at an earlier event, was rendered “civically naked and unprotected” by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2013. In that decision, Shelby County v. Holder, the Court struck down a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, effectively allowing certain jurisdictions with histories of voting discrimination to overhaul their laws without federal oversight. In the five states that the march’s organizers chose to include in their route—Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia—Republican legislatures had passed stringent <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/new-voting-restrictions-2010-election" target="_blank">voter-I.D. measures and other restrictions</a> known to disproportionately affect minorities.</p> <p>It was a warm and sunny morning, and behind Brooks’s head rose the dome of the Capitol, covered in restoration scaffolding. He was flanked by several Democratic senators and House members, who were there to speak in support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill to restore the V.R.A. Nobody was under any illusion that the bill would pass, at least in the foreseeable future; only one Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, has endorsed it. But voting rights, Brooks wanted to make clear, had never been handed down from on high. Rather, they are something for which Americans have had to fight and die. “We understand that the ink of a President’s pen may have signed that legislation into law,” he said, referring to the V.R.A. “But it was enacted with the blood, sweat, and tears of our people, from every hue and every heritage, from every race and every religion.”</p> <p>Brooks cited the example of the first marcher to show up in Selma, a sixty-eight-year-old Vietnam veteran from Colorado who went by the name Middle Passage. His was the sort of courage, Brooks said, that would be required on the road ahead. Despite a history of heart trouble, Middle Passage had marched nine hundred and twenty miles, through parts of the country where the heat index reached a hundred and fourteen degrees and where, for the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, black people were prevented from voting. According to the N.A.A.C.P., he collapsed on the road on September 12th and died shortly thereafter. “He lost his life marching for the right to vote,” Brooks said.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, spoke about the V.R.A.A. “What is wrong with a law that says all Americans—<em>all Americans</em>—should be able to vote?” he asked. “Isn’t that a blessing?” Mark Warner, a senator from Virginia, came next, remarking, “Pretty wild, in 2015, that the only major country in the world that is actually trying to restrict people’s right to vote is the United States of America.” A few minutes later, a Texas representative named Sheila Jackson Lee took the lectern. “I was moved by the story of Middle Passage,” she said. “I’m going to be calling his name. I’m going to be in the Judiciary Committee, calling Middle Passage’s name!”</p> <p>The Reverend William Barber, the head of the North Carolina chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., spoke next. He was hunched forward as he approached the microphone, as if shouldering a great burden. His state has become an unlikely battleground for voting rights. In 2013, shortly after the Supreme Court announced its decision, North Carolina’s G.O.P. supermajority passed the Voter Information Verification Act. The law, which was nominally designed “to restore confidence in government” by promoting “education and increased registration,” required voters to show one of six forms of government-issued I.D. at the polls. It also eliminated same-day registration, out-of-precinct voting, preregistration for sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds, and a week of early voting—measures that fall hardest on communities of color. Barber and the N.A.A.C.P. eventually coördinated a campaign to improve voter turnout, with the result that the proportion of black voters actually grew between the 2010 and 2014 elections, in spite of the new restrictions. First, though, they brought a lawsuit against the state.</p> <p>The verdict in that case is due any day now, and it may provide a precedent for similar disputes elsewhere in the nation. Some form of voter-I.D. law is in effect in thirty-two states. In several of the major congressional races in 2014, as Elizabeth Drew <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/may/21/big-dangers-next-election/" target="_blank">reported</a> in <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, the difference in the number of votes between the victor and the loser was roughly equivalent to the number of people who, as a result of new voting restrictions, were deprived of the right to vote. In North Carolina, there was the additional problem of gerrymandering. After the 2010 census, the state legislature launched a round of redistricting, often along racial and political lines. As a result, in 2012, although North Carolinians split their votes evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates, the G.O.P. won two-thirds of the state legislature and nine of the state’s thirteen congressional seats. Partly as a result of tactics like these, the Republican Party now has total control in twenty-four states, while the Democratic Party has total control in only seven. “It’s going in an anti-democratic direction,” Michael Curtis, a constitutional historian who teaches at Wake Forest University School of Law, in North Carolina, told me. “At some point, I think there’s a danger that you could reach a tipping point where things are so anti-democratic that, while you have the form of a democratic government, you no longer have the substance. It’s become sort of an oligarchy.”</p> <p>Although the North Carolina legislature softened the I.D. requirement of the Voter Information Verification Act before the N.A.A.C.P.’s suit went to trial, this summer, Barber has dismissed it as “just another backdoor way of doing a literacy test.” At the rally, he echoed Brooks as cheerfully as he could, reminding the crowd that they were in the midst of an enduring struggle, and that more sacrifice would be needed. “Now, Henry Thoreau went to jail for civil disobedience,” he said. “Ralph Waldo Emerson came by and said, ‘Henry, what is a nice man like you doing in jail?’ And Henry said, ‘Considering the injustices of slavery, what are you doing <em>not</em> in jail?’ ” As if to confirm that the rally’s big tent had room for Thoreauvian environmentalists, too, Aaron Mair, the president of the Sierra Club, had shown up. His was one of more than fifty partner organizations supporting America’s Journey for Justice. “The Voting Rights Act is the most sound and sane thing that the Sierra Club and all environmental organizations can be involved in at this point in time,” he told me. (Because minorities tend to vote Democratic, their disenfranchisement has a real effect on the issues that matter to Mair’s constituency.)</p> <p>As the event wound down, activists traded handshakes and business cards and posed for photos.&nbsp;I asked Cornell Brooks whether he thought that the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. would win its case against the state. He replied that the fact that such litigation is even necessary is “a wasteful, morally unjustified extravagance.” Enormous resources are going to defending voting rights on a state-by-state basis—in other words, to fight laws that never would have seen the light of day before the V.R.A. was weakened by Shelby County v. Holder. “We can’t litigate these cases on the eve of an election around the country and hope to have fair, transparent, and trustworthy elections,” he said. “You’ve got to fix the Voting Rights Act.”</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Last Wednesday, toward the beginning of a speech in Washington, D.C., Cornell Brooks, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, invoked Scripture. “God gave these words to Joshua: ‘Be strong and of good courage,’ ” Brooks said.

Despite a history of heart trouble, Middle Passage had marched nine hundred and twenty miles, through parts of the country where the heat index reached a hundred and fourteen degrees and where, for the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, black people were prevented from voting. According to the N.A.A.C.P., he collapsed on the road on September 12th and died shortly thereafter. “He lost his life marching for the right to vote,” Brooks said.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, spoke about the V.R.A.A. “What is wrong with a law that says all Americans—<em>all Americans</em>—should be able to vote?” he asked. “Isn’t that a blessing?” Mark Warner, a senator from Virginia, came next, remarking, “Pretty wild, in 2015, that the only major country in the world that is actually trying to restrict people’s right to vote is the United States of America.” A few minutes later, a Texas representative named Sheila Jackson Lee took the lectern. “I was moved by the story of Middle Passage,” she said. “I’m going to be calling his name. I’m going to be in the Judiciary Committee, calling Middle Passage’s name!”</p> <p>The Reverend William Barber, the head of the North Carolina chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., spoke next. He was hunched forward as he approached the microphone, as if shouldering a great burden. His state has become an unlikely battleground for voting rights. In 2013, shortly after the Supreme Court announced its decision, North Carolina’s G.O.P. supermajority passed the Voter Information Verification Act. The law, which was nominally designed “to restore confidence in government” by promoting “education and increased registration,” required voters to show one of six forms of government-issued I.D. at the polls. It also eliminated same-day registration, out-of-precinct voting, preregistration for sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds, and a week of early voting—measures that fall hardest on communities of color. Barber and the N.A.A.C.P. eventually coördinated a campaign to improve voter turnout, with the result that the proportion of black voters actually grew between the 2010 and 2014 elections, in spite of the new restrictions. First, though, they brought a lawsuit against the state.</p> <p>The verdict in that case is due any day now, and it may provide a precedent for similar disputes elsewhere in the nation. Some form of voter-I.D. law is in effect in thirty-two states. In several of the major congressional races in 2014, as Elizabeth Drew <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/may/21/big-dangers-next-election/" target="_blank">reported</a> in <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, the difference in the number of votes between the victor and the loser was roughly equivalent to the number of people who, as a result of new voting restrictions, were deprived of the right to vote. In North Carolina, there was the additional problem of gerrymandering. After the 2010 census, the state legislature launched a round of redistricting, often along racial and political lines. As a result, in 2012, although North Carolinians split their votes evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates, the G.O.P. won two-thirds of the state legislature and nine of the state’s thirteen congressional seats. Partly as a result of tactics like these, the Republican Party now has total control in twenty-four states, while the Democratic Party has total control in only seven. “It’s going in an anti-democratic direction,” Michael Curtis, a constitutional historian who teaches at Wake Forest University School of Law, in North Carolina, told me. “At some point, I think there’s a danger that you could reach a tipping point where things are so anti-democratic that, while you have the form of a democratic government, you no longer have the substance. It’s become sort of an oligarchy.”</p> <p>Although the North Carolina legislature softened the I.D. requirement of the Voter Information Verification Act before the N.A.A.C.P.’s suit went to trial, this summer, Barber has dismissed it as “just another backdoor way of doing a literacy test.” At the rally, he echoed Brooks as cheerfully as he could, reminding the crowd that they were in the midst of an enduring struggle, and that more sacrifice would be needed. “Now, Henry Thoreau went to jail for civil disobedience,” he said. “Ralph Waldo Emerson came by and said, ‘Henry, what is a nice man like you doing in jail?’ And Henry said, ‘Considering the injustices of slavery, what are you doing <em>not</em> in jail?’ ” As if to confirm that the rally’s big tent had room for Thoreauvian environmentalists, too, Aaron Mair, the president of the Sierra Club, had shown up. His was one of more than fifty partner organizations supporting America’s Journey for Justice. “The Voting Rights Act is the most sound and sane thing that the Sierra Club and all environmental organizations can be involved in at this point in time,” he told me. (Because minorities tend to vote Democratic, their disenfranchisement has a real effect on the issues that matter to Mair’s constituency.)</p> <p>As the event wound down, activists traded handshakes and business cards and posed for photos.&nbsp;I asked Cornell Brooks whether he thought that the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. would win its case against the state. He replied that the fact that such litigation is even necessary is “a wasteful, morally unjustified extravagance.” Enormous resources are going to defending voting rights on a state-by-state basis—in other words, to fight laws that never would have seen the light of day before the V.R.A. was weakened by Shelby County v. Holder. “We can’t litigate these cases on the eve of an election around the country and hope to have fair, transparent, and trustworthy elections,” he said. “You’ve got to fix the Voting Rights Act.”</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

The most important component of this plumbing is a cat’s cradle of undersea cables. In the decades since the first transatlantic fibre-optic telephone line was laid, in 1988, such cables have multiplied and spread as bandwidth demands have grown. There are currently <a href="http://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/">three hundred and forty-three</a> of them already active or under construction, and they run more than half a million miles, traversing every ocean and connecting every continent except Antarctica, running up and down the coasts of Africa, through the Hawaiian Islands, and up into Alaska and Greenland. It can be hard to imagine—the Internet itself passing just below the waves of that surf break in California, through the rocks of a craggy coastline in England, over the aquamarine-tinged reefs of southern Florida, under your towel at a beach on Long Island. What is even harder to reckon with is the fact that this growing and critical network, as Edward Snowden proved, is perhaps the most powerful surveillance tool in the world.</p> <p>The artist Trevor Paglen’s latest exhibition, which opened recently at <a href="http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/exhibitions/2015-09-10_trevor-paglen/">Metro Pictures Gallery</a>, in Chelsea, is designed to help you in the reckoning. Paglen has long focussed on what the show’s description calls “the geography and aesthetics” of the American surveillance state. His book “Blank Spots on the Map,” from 2009, catalogues crucial sites in the country’s global spying network, and his video footage of some of them was included in “Citizenfour,” the Oscar-winning documentary on Snowden. When Paglen turned his attention to the undersea-cable system, he was surprised by its simplicity. “The cables come ashore on the east coast of the U.S. in just a few main places—around New York, on Long Island and in New Jersey, and in Florida, around Miami,” he explained when we first spoke, via Skype. (Paglen was in Berlin and I was in New York; the irony of our cable dependency was not lost on either of us.) This structure has historical underpinnings. Many of the new cables follow similar paths to the old telegraph and telephone lines, and many of the landing sites and switching stations are holdovers, too. This creates choke points in the system, with many strands meeting in one place—easier for the companies that operate the cables to monitor, and easier for the N.S.A. to tap.</p> <p>The Metro Pictures show, which spans three rooms in the gallery’s garagelike space, begins with a nod to this history: included in one of Paglen’s collages is a cartoon called “<a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2004665357/">The Laying of the Cable</a>,” which commemorates the completion of the first transatlantic telegraph line, in 1858. The exhibition proceeds from there, each image or object imbued with some suggestion of the breadth of surveillance. There is a leaked N.S.A. document that has been redacted to the point of being two large black rectangles; a two-foot-long model of the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter, a nuclear submarine that is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/new-nuclear-sub-is-said-to-have-special-eavesdropping-ability.html">reputed</a> to have the ability to tap cables sitting on the ocean floor; a photo of the starry night sky with a <a href="http://satellites.findthedata.com/l/410/USA-200">spy satellite</a>’s light trail barely visible at its center; and an endlessly scrolling list of hundreds of top-secret code names for N.S.A. operations (Electron Sword, Quantum Mush, Elegant Chaos, Ferret Cannon, Tiger Donut, Koala Punch).</p> <p>The cables themselves are on view in a series of four photos taken underwater, offshore from landing sites near Miami. “The diving project came out of looking at these choke points, looking at the images, the charts, the maps, and saying, ‘Well, can you just go in there and find them?’ ” Paglen said. He did not know how to scuba dive, so he learned. Although the locations of cables near shore can be roughly guessed at using nautical charts and G.P.S., their exact location is something of a mystery; Paglen and his team had to mark out a search grid to find and photograph them.

The most important component of this plumbing is a cat’s cradle of undersea cables. In the decades since the first transatlantic fibre-optic telephone line was laid, in 1988, such cables have multiplied and spread as bandwidth demands have grown. There are currently <a href="http://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/">three hundred and forty-three</a> of them already active or under construction, and they run more than half a million miles, traversing every ocean and connecting every continent except Antarctica, running up and down the coasts of Africa, through the Hawaiian Islands, and up into Alaska and Greenland. It can be hard to imagine—the Internet itself passing just below the waves of that surf break in California, through the rocks of a craggy coastline in England, over the aquamarine-tinged reefs of southern Florida, under your towel at a beach on Long Island. What is even harder to reckon with is the fact that this growing and critical network, as Edward Snowden proved, is perhaps the most powerful surveillance tool in the world.</p> <p>The artist Trevor Paglen’s latest exhibition, which opened recently at <a href="http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/exhibitions/2015-09-10_trevor-paglen/">Metro Pictures Gallery</a>, in Chelsea, is designed to help you in the reckoning. Paglen has long focussed on what the show’s description calls “the geography and aesthetics” of the American surveillance state. His book “Blank Spots on the Map,” from 2009, catalogues crucial sites in the country’s global spying network, and his video footage of some of them was included in “Citizenfour,” the Oscar-winning documentary on Snowden. When Paglen turned his attention to the undersea-cable system, he was surprised by its simplicity. “The cables come ashore on the east coast of the U.S. in just a few main places—around New York, on Long Island and in New Jersey, and in Florida, around Miami,” he explained when we first spoke, via Skype. (Paglen was in Berlin and I was in New York; the irony of our cable dependency was not lost on either of us.) This structure has historical underpinnings. Many of the new cables follow similar paths to the old telegraph and telephone lines, and many of the landing sites and switching stations are holdovers, too. This creates choke points in the system, with many strands meeting in one place—easier for the companies that operate the cables to monitor, and easier for the N.S.A. to tap.</p> <p>The Metro Pictures show, which spans three rooms in the gallery’s garagelike space, begins with a nod to this history: included in one of Paglen’s collages is a cartoon called “<a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2004665357/">The Laying of the Cable</a>,” which commemorates the completion of the first transatlantic telegraph line, in 1858. The exhibition proceeds from there, each image or object imbued with some suggestion of the breadth of surveillance. There is a leaked N.S.A. document that has been redacted to the point of being two large black rectangles; a two-foot-long model of the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter, a nuclear submarine that is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/new-nuclear-sub-is-said-to-have-special-eavesdropping-ability.html">reputed</a> to have the ability to tap cables sitting on the ocean floor; a photo of the starry night sky with a <a href="http://satellites.findthedata.com/l/410/USA-200">spy satellite</a>’s light trail barely visible at its center; and an endlessly scrolling list of hundreds of top-secret code names for N.S.A. operations (Electron Sword, Quantum Mush, Elegant Chaos, Ferret Cannon, Tiger Donut, Koala Punch).</p> <p>The cables themselves are on view in a series of four photos taken underwater, offshore from landing sites near Miami. “The diving project came out of looking at these choke points, looking at the images, the charts, the maps, and saying, ‘Well, can you just go in there and find them?’ ” Paglen said. He did not know how to scuba dive, so he learned. Although the locations of cables near shore can be roughly guessed at using nautical charts and G.P.S., their exact location is something of a mystery; Paglen and his team had to mark out a search grid to find and photograph them. The resulting images are beautiful, suffused with a sinister deep-blue inkiness, each with an unnaturally straight black line running over the sand and detritus on the seafloor—the cable itself, just sitting there.</p> <p>The centerpiece of the show, in the final room, is a remarkable two-channel video installation made up of cast-off shots from the ninety hours of footage that Paglen shot for “Citizenfour.” Each of the wide-screen landscape panoramas is in some way intruded on by the apparatus of the surveillance state.

I’m officially off the grid!</p> <p>After I get settled in at the shack, I go for a hike. I see an owl that looks just like Chris Pine. I want to Instagram him, but obviously can’t. At first this frustrates me, but then I realize that Chris Pine Owl probably doesn’t want to be online. He’s better than that. He’s not just one more Instagram bird of prey who resembles a B-list actor.</p> <p>I catch some fish for dinner. Or, rather, I find a couple dead fish floating in a sort of stagnant part of a nearby creek. I want to cook the fish without using the matches and Duraflame log I brought, but I’m unable to watch any online tutorials, so I shamefully take the easy route. I eat the worst meal of my life and vomit for several hours.</p> <p>The next morning, I awake from a dream in which I received an e-mail from my boss with the subject heading “<small>PUT OUT THIS FIRE</small>!!!” I flail around looking for my phone before remembering where I am. Outside, the Duraflame is still smoldering. Several animals howl.</p> <p>I drink some water from the part of the creek that is actually moving. Then I swim in it, naked. It feels amazing. I hear a man yelling. I thought I was alone, but I turn and see a family having a picnic in an adjacent clearing. The man demands I put on a bathing suit. I ask him if he is also writing a personal essay about living off the grid. He threatens to call the park service. I ask how he would do that, and he says that there’s a pay phone at the trailhead, a quarter mile away.</p> <p>I do some sketching to pass the time. I try to draw Chris Pine Owl, but it doesn’t look like Chris Pine or an owl. I’m bored as crap.</p> <p>I begin to feel phantom vibrations in my pants pocket, but when I try to reach for my phone I realize I am still naked. Maybe I should’ve brought my phone to take pictures to upload <em>later</em>. What if I see an opossum that looks just like Zachary Quinto? No one will believe me.</p> <p>I’m starving. I find some berries, but I can’t consult the “Edible Berry or Nah” Twitter account, so I’m rolling the dice. The berries do little to sate my hunger. I find some mushrooms. I wonder if there’s a “Hallucinogenic Mushroom or Nah” Twitter account, but of course that’s moot. I’m washing wild mushrooms in a stream, naked; I feel pure, untethered, free. I see a heron (I think) that kind of looks like the character actor Paul Ben-Victor, but it’s a stretch. “Birds are just birds, man,” I say out loud, to myself.</p> <p>I eat the mushrooms and wander back to the shack. I start to feel all floaty and weird. I think I’m falling asleep, but I’m not sure. At dusk, I hear the beasts of the wild calling for me. I leave the shack, but instead of finding a bunch of animals I come upon a tree stump with a built-in phone-charging station and Wi-Fi hot spot. I go to plug my phone in, but the cord slithers around my arm. I try to free myself, but it tightens its grasp, and then more cords get hold of me.

He shared short samples of the tracks on Instagram, and news quickly got to Swift, who responded with delight. “is this true??????? I WILL PASS OUT,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/629212668218314752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a>. The two then exchanged late-night social-media fan letters. “Badass tunes, Taylor. : ) We’re sandblasting them and they’re holding steady,” Adams tweeted. “Cool I’m not gonna be able to sleep tonight or ever again and I’m going to celebrate today every year as a holiday. I’M CALM,” Swift replied.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, Adams teased out more details of what had become a full-blown cover project—the recording was done, they were mixing tracks, the album art was finished. Last week, Swift, who has cited Adams’s music as inspiring her own songwriting, called the whole thing <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/644535114203025408?lang=en">“surreal and dreamlike.”</a> But, then again, many things in Swift’s life must seem surreal. She won a lifetime achievement award when she was <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/lifetime-achievements">twenty-three</a>. Now, at twenty-five, she has a tribute album performed by a forty-year-old Americana hero whom she’s long admired. Adams’s track-by-track reinterpretation of “1989” was released at midnight on Monday.</p> <p>When the project just existed on social media, it seemed like a lark and a bit of mischief from Adams, who has been admired and fretted over as something of a genius imp—an occasionally combative performer with an amazing surfeit of material who records albums quickly (more than fifteen in as many years), in many different styles, and with varying degrees of irony and sincerity. Was his “1989” some kind of subversive repurposing of the most popular album in the world?</p> <p>It certainly doesn’t sound that way. In short order, Adams took songs that, due to their popularity, belong to the world, and made them his own. “Blank Space,” Swift’s posh, sexy provocation about the thrills of being a wild woman, becomes, in Adams’s hands, a hushed, whispery lamentation of troubled love. In that song, Swift’s “long list of ex-lovers” is a boast about the hearts she’s broken; the same line, sung by Adams, is a warning about his emotional baggage, the heartbreaks he’s suffered. In its original form, the synth-pop hit “Out of the Woods” throttles forward even as Swift laments the past. Here, it’s stripped down and stretched out to six minutes, with the incantation of the chorus confronting us with aching regret. Swift’s version makes escape feel possible; Adams imagines being lost, or trapped.</p> <p>As Adams described in an interview with Zane Lowe, on Beats 1 radio, his interest in Swift’s songs came out of admiration for her work (Adams compared the effect of her songwriting&nbsp;on him&nbsp;to that of Hüsker Dü and the Smiths) and a place of sadness in his own life. He originally recorded four songs from “1989” on an old four-track cassette recorder, in the acoustic style of Bruce Springsteen’s harrowing “Nebraska.” (Those originals were lost.) The souped-up versions that eventually made it onto the album, recorded with the guitarist Todd Wisenbaker, retain an urgent, confessional, lonely feeling. If anything, Adams’s version of “1989” is more earnest and, in its way, sincere and sentimental than the original. Of his version of “Out of the Woods,” Adams said, “I could feel that song releasing from my body like I wasn’t there.” His tribute album doesn’t sound anything like a joke, and if it is one Adams is playing an especially long con.</p> <p>Despite the enthusiasm that Adams expressed for the project this summer, there was still reason for skepticism, among fans of either Adams, Swift, or both. There is, after all, a long and rich history of the ironic cover song, with independent, or iconoclastic, or niche artists covering Top Forty hits, often live in concert, and mostly to the screaming delight of their audience. (There is less evidence, however, of the ironic cover album.) Punk groups covering songs by boy bands, white rock groups singing hip-hop, <a href="http://speakimge.com/the-12-most-bizarre-metal-covers-of-non-metal-songs/">heavy-metal versions of Britney Spears</a>. The stunt is mostly understood as a knowing self-juxtaposition of the artists’ own integrity with the banal popularity of the hit songs they are covering. But the crowd often goes wild not simply because they think they are in on the right side of a joke about mass culture. Good pop songs sound good when anyone plays them, because they are often just really good songs, whether it’s cool to say so or not.</p> <p>Yet Adams has, despite coming off as iconoclastic and self-serious in interviews, been reliably broad-minded and unaffected in his musical tastes. He recorded a cover of Oasis’s chart topper “Wonderwall,” for his 2004 album “Love Is Hell,” long after it had become cool to dismiss Oasis as an unfortunate contagion of the nineties. A few years later, the song’s writer, Noel Gallagher, told <em>Spin</em>, “I think Ryan Adams is the only person who ever got that song right.” This April, during a performance in Nashville, Adams, who had discussed his annoyance at being confused with the singer Bryan Adams, performed an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=57&amp;v=ni_-e5Mb3hU">elegant acoustic cover</a> of that singer’s 1984 megahit “Summer of ’69.” He didn’t appear to be joking. Instead, he placed the song, as he does with Swift’s music, immediately within his own emotional register. It sounded like a Ryan Adams song. The audience, which in the light of day might be inclined to mock the vanilla middle-American soft rock of Bryan Adams, sang along. It knew all the words.</p> <p>There may be a temptation among certain fans of alt-country, Americana, or rock and roll to see Ryan Adams’s version of “1989” as a major improvement on the original, a clearing away of the dance-pop flourishes and general polish that Swift settled on, in collaboration with the producers Max Martin and Shellback. These songs, rearranged by Adams, might sound to some ears more authentic, raw, or genuine—suddenly more his than hers. “Clean,” the closing track, is, from Swift, a wistful song of lost love. By Adams, it is a jangly, wistful song about headier topics: addiction, recovery, and loss. Yet the delivery is flat and a bit rushed, as if he had memorized the words in a language he doesn’t speak. Can we trust the feeling?</p> <p>But, if anything Adams’s “1989” is, at times, too serious or reverent toward Swift’s songs. It leaves out the album’s bravado, cheeky humor, and plain silliness. The blissfully high-energy, goofy, and danceable “Shake It Off” stalls as a brooding and meandering dirge. The banal chorus of “Bad Blood” (“Now we’ve got problems / And I don’t think we can solve them”) can’t withstand Adams’s confessional style. And not even the most loving interpretation could rehabilitate the chamber-of-commerce-approved “Welcome to New York.” Swift is able to wink, or dance, or pose in videos, which help qualify the more emotive moments on the album; Adams embraces them completely, making occasionally sentimental and earnest pop songs even more so, as if he were the twenty-five-year-old. There is something slightly unnerving about just how quickly, and seemingly easily, Adams was able to recast them in his own image—if he can make anything sound heartbreaking, just how meaningful is a broken heart?</p> <p>Still, as a longtime fan of Adams, I’ve been won over by his commitment to surplus, to excess. It’s clear that he has a good time making sad songs. This might seem like insincerity, like pathos conjured out of thin air in a kind of musical magic trick. But Adams’s confusing motivations have always been part of whatever tension surrounds his music. Something in his state of mind and musical sensibility listened to the romantic exuberance of a young woman’s pop album and heard his own melancholy. He responded with music that is both personal and generous.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>In August, the prolific singer-songwriter Ryan Adams began recording cover versions of the songs from Taylor Swift’s album “1989” during night sessions at his studio in Los Angeles. He shared short samples of the tracks on Instagram, and news quickly got to Swift, who responded with delight. “is this true??????? I WILL PASS OUT,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/629212668218314752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a>. The two then exchanged late-night social-media fan letters. “Badass tunes, Taylor. : ) We’re sandblasting them and they’re holding steady,” Adams tweeted. “Cool I’m not gonna be able to sleep tonight or ever again and I’m going to celebrate today every year as a holiday. I’M CALM,” Swift replied.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, Adams teased out more details of what had become a full-blown cover project—the recording was done, they were mixing tracks, the album art was finished. Last week, Swift, who has cited Adams’s music as inspiring her own songwriting, called the whole thing <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/644535114203025408?lang=en">“surreal and dreamlike.”</a> But, then again, many things in Swift’s life must seem surreal. She won a lifetime achievement award when she was <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/lifetime-achievements">twenty-three</a>. Now, at twenty-five, she has a tribute album performed by a forty-year-old Americana hero whom she’s long admired. Adams’s track-by-track reinterpretation of “1989” was released at midnight on Monday.</p> <p>When the project just existed on social media, it seemed like a lark and a bit of mischief from Adams, who has been admired and fretted over as something of a genius imp—an occasionally combative performer with an amazing surfeit of material who records albums quickly (more than fifteen in as many years), in many different styles, and with varying degrees of irony and sincerity. Was his “1989” some kind of subversive repurposing of the most popular album in the world?</p> <p>It certainly doesn’t sound that way. In short order, Adams took songs that, due to their popularity, belong to the world, and made them his own. “Blank Space,” Swift’s posh, sexy provocation about the thrills of being a wild woman, becomes, in Adams’s hands, a hushed, whispery lamentation of troubled love. In that song, Swift’s “long list of ex-lovers” is a boast about the hearts she’s broken; the same line, sung by Adams, is a warning about his emotional baggage, the heartbreaks he’s suffered. In its original form, the synth-pop hit “Out of the Woods” throttles forward even as Swift laments the past. Here, it’s stripped down and stretched out to six minutes, with the incantation of the chorus confronting us with aching regret. Swift’s version makes escape feel possible; Adams imagines being lost, or trapped.</p> <p>As Adams described in an interview with Zane Lowe, on Beats 1 radio, his interest in Swift’s songs came out of admiration for her work (Adams compared the effect of her songwriting&nbsp;on him&nbsp;to that of Hüsker Dü and the Smiths) and a place of sadness in his own life. He originally recorded four songs from “1989” on an old four-track cassette recorder, in the acoustic style of Bruce Springsteen’s harrowing “Nebraska.” (Those originals were lost.) The souped-up versions that eventually made it onto the album, recorded with the guitarist Todd Wisenbaker, retain an urgent, confessional, lonely feeling. If anything, Adams’s version of “1989” is more earnest and, in its way, sincere and sentimental than the original. Of his version of “Out of the Woods,” Adams said, “I could feel that song releasing from my body like I wasn’t there.” His tribute album doesn’t sound anything like a joke, and if it is one Adams is playing an especially long con.</p> <p>Despite the enthusiasm that Adams expressed for the project this summer, there was still reason for skepticism, among fans of either Adams, Swift, or both. There is, after all, a long and rich history of the ironic cover song, with independent, or iconoclastic, or niche artists covering Top Forty hits, often live in concert, and mostly to the screaming delight of their audience. (There is less evidence, however, of the ironic cover album.) Punk groups covering songs by boy bands, white rock groups singing hip-hop, <a href="http://speakimge.com/the-12-most-bizarre-metal-covers-of-non-metal-songs/">heavy-metal versions of Britney Spears</a>. The stunt is mostly understood as a knowing self-juxtaposition of the artists’ own integrity with the banal popularity of the hit songs they are covering. But the crowd often goes wild not simply because they think they are in on the right side of a joke about mass culture. Good pop songs sound good when anyone plays them, because they are often just really good songs, whether it’s cool to say so or not.</p> <p>Yet Adams has, despite coming off as iconoclastic and self-serious in interviews, been reliably broad-minded and unaffected in his musical tastes. He recorded a cover of Oasis’s chart topper “Wonderwall,” for his 2004 album “Love Is Hell,” long after it had become cool to dismiss Oasis as an unfortunate contagion of the nineties. A few years later, the song’s writer, Noel Gallagher, told <em>Spin</em>, “I think Ryan Adams is the only person who ever got that song right.” This April, during a performance in Nashville, Adams, who had discussed his annoyance at being confused with the singer Bryan Adams, performed an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=57&amp;v=ni_-e5Mb3hU">elegant acoustic cover</a> of that singer’s 1984 megahit “Summer of ’69.” He didn’t appear to be joking.

Survivor,” the ongoing reality show starring Donald Trump, is attracting record viewing figures.&nbsp;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/17/media/cnn-republican-debate-ratings/">According to CNN</a>, more than twenty-three million Americans watched last week’s edition, which saw Carly Fiorina<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility">&nbsp;seek to topple Trump</a>&nbsp;from his perch atop the opinion polls. Since this week’s show was set to compete with the Pope, who will likely be an even bigger draw, the producers moved it to Monday evening, almost twenty-four hours before Il Papa was scheduled to fly into Joint Base Andrews.</p> <p>The star, if that’s the right word, of the evening was Scott Walker, the forty-seven-year-old governor of Wisconsin. Back in February, Walker delighted conservatives with a speech in Iowa, and, in late March, he briefly&nbsp;rose to the top of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html">Real Clear Politics poll average</a>. Fastening on his blue-collar roots, his record as a liberal-defying union buster, and his potential to unite economic conservatives and social conservatives, many commentators, this one&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker">included</a>, identified him as a serious contender for the nomination.&nbsp;So did some big-time Republican donors, including David Koch, who&nbsp;said that Walker would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/04/20/koch-brothers-signal-support-for-scott-walker/">the G.O.P. nominee</a>, and Anthony Scaramucci, a fund manager from New York, who&nbsp;predicted that Walker would become&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/2015/07/13/why-scott-can-win-white-house/">the forty-fifth President</a>.</p> <p>Fast forward to Monday evening, when Walker&nbsp;delivered a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/video/?bctid=4499846322001">four-minute statement</a>&nbsp;at the Edgewater Hotel, in Madison. He recalled standing onstage with the other candidates at the Ronald Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, last week, and thinking about how, when he was a kid, Reagan’s “eternal optimism” had appealed to him. “Sadly the debate taking place in the Republican Party today is not focussed on that optimistic view of America,”&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walkers-full-statement-on-suspending-campaign-b99581511z1-328575531.html">Walker said</a>. “Instead it has drifted into personal attacks.&nbsp;In the end, I believe that the voters want to be for something, and not against someone. Instead of talking about how bad things are, we want to hear how we can make them better for everyone. We need to get back to the basics of our party.”</p> <p>Walker didn’t mention Trump by name—he didn’t have to. Like Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/11/rick-perry-drops-out-republican-presidential-election">dropped out of the race</a>&nbsp;two weeks ago, and like all the other regular politicians who are still in the contest, Walker&nbsp;suffered gravely from Trump’s ability to suck attention away from everybody else, save for those candidates who attacked Trump or were attacked by him.&nbsp;“I was sitting in church yesterday; the pastor’s words reminded me that the Bible is full of stories about people who were called to be leaders in unusual ways,” Walker went on. “Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field. With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately. I encourage other Republican Presidential candidates to consider doing the same, so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner.”</p> <p>In truth, Walker’s campaign was faltering even before mid-June, when Trump got&nbsp;into the race. Early on, a number of his statements had raised questions about his knowledge of national and international issues, and about whether he could make the jump from local to national politics. (While touting his foreign-policy credentials, for example, he appeared to equate pro-labor union demonstrators with members of <small>ISIS</small> and other deadly groups, remarking, “If I can take on a hundred thousand protesters, I can do the same across the world.”) In April and May, his poll numbers dropped back. Indeed, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scott-walkers-own-limitations-did-him-in/article/2572552">interview</a>&nbsp;with Byron York, of the&nbsp;<em>Washington Examiner</em>, Walker conceded that his rapid rise&nbsp;in the spring&nbsp;had caught him off guard.&nbsp;“We thought all along if we got in, it would be kind of this slow and steady, ‘Don’t worry about the other guys, just keep focused on moving forward,’&nbsp;and as candidates chose not to get in or fell off, we’d be in a position to make a compelling case to them,” he said.</p> <p>But if Walker made some rookie errors, Trump’s arrival on the scene raised the stakes and accelerated the pace for all of the candidates. What had seemed as though it would be a lengthy war of attrition turned into a popularity contest carried on in the full glare of the national media, with Trump stealing most of the attention. Walker, it turned out, wasn’t well suited to this type of politics. A somewhat stiff public speaker, he went largely unnoticed in the first televised debate. In the second, last week, he, at times, seemed to be reciting sound bites that he had rehearsed, and which weren’t very clever. For example, addressing Trump, he said that America couldn’t afford another “apprentice” in the White House, which raised the question of whether he actually knew what role the billionaire played in the long-running reality show. In a CNN poll carried out in the days after the debate, his support among likely Republican voters fell below one per cent, earning him&nbsp;a dreaded asterisk&nbsp;<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/20/rel10a.pdf">in the tabulated results</a>.</p> <p>Even before the CNN debate, Walker’s campaign appears to have been in worse trouble than most outsiders realized. As Trump’s poll numbers rose and fell, Walker’s ability to raise money, the lifeblood of any Presidential campaign—particularly one that was spending heavily to build a national infrastructure—was gravely undermined. Much of the cash that Walker had raised had already been spent, and, according to some reports, his staff members were having trouble attracting people to a fundraiser scheduled this week in New York. An&nbsp;article&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/21/scott-walker-quits-2016-presidential-race/">Times</a></em>, which broke the story of Walker’s withdrawal, said that “campaign bills were piling up, with some vendors complaining that they had not been paid on time.” The&nbsp;Milwaukee <em>Journal Sentinel</em>, Wisconsin’s largest newspaper,&nbsp;quoted a G.O.P. source&nbsp;who said, “If it wasn’t for cash flow, he’d still be here.”</p> <p>Rather than borrowing money and racking up big debts, Walker evidently accepted the verdict of the moneymen and debate viewers. Now that he’s&nbsp;done, the pundits are busy picking over his entrails, with the early consensus being that Senator Marco Rubio is likely to prove the primary beneficiary of his demise. Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster and Trump antagonist, remarked to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/scott-walker-is-dropping-out-of-republican-primary-race#.fnDD24e9A">BuzzFeed</a>&nbsp;that “a lot of Walker supporters had Rubio as their second choice, and a lot of Rubio supporters had Walker as their second choice.” Indeed, immediately after Walker’s announcement, some of his most prominent supporters in New Hampshire had&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wmur.com/politics/more-trouble-for-scott-walker-state-cochair-cliff-hurst-defects-to-marco-rubio/35397170">thrown their support</a>&nbsp;to Rubio.</p> <p>Walker’s foes, meanwhile, celebrated his departure.

Survivor,” the ongoing reality show starring Donald Trump, is attracting record viewing figures.&nbsp;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/17/media/cnn-republican-debate-ratings/">According to CNN</a>, more than twenty-three million Americans watched last week’s edition, which saw Carly Fiorina<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/carly-fiorina-tests-donald-trumps-indestructibility">&nbsp;seek to topple Trump</a>&nbsp;from his perch atop the opinion polls. Since this week’s show was set to compete with the Pope, who will likely be an even bigger draw, the producers moved it to Monday evening, almost twenty-four hours before Il Papa was scheduled to fly into Joint Base Andrews.</p> <p>The star, if that’s the right word, of the evening was Scott Walker, the forty-seven-year-old governor of Wisconsin. Back in February, Walker delighted conservatives with a speech in Iowa, and, in late March, he briefly&nbsp;rose to the top of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html">Real Clear Politics poll average</a>. Fastening on his blue-collar roots, his record as a liberal-defying union buster, and his potential to unite economic conservatives and social conservatives, many commentators, this one&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/dangerous-candidacy-scott-walker">included</a>, identified him as a serious contender for the nomination.&nbsp;So did some big-time Republican donors, including David Koch, who&nbsp;said that Walker would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/04/20/koch-brothers-signal-support-for-scott-walker/">the G.O.P. nominee</a>, and Anthony Scaramucci, a fund manager from New York, who&nbsp;predicted that Walker would become&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/2015/07/13/why-scott-can-win-white-house/">the forty-fifth President</a>.</p> <p>Fast forward to Monday evening, when Walker&nbsp;delivered a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/video/?bctid=4499846322001">four-minute statement</a>&nbsp;at the Edgewater Hotel, in Madison. He recalled standing onstage with the other candidates at the Ronald Reagan Library, in Simi Valley, last week, and thinking about how, when he was a kid, Reagan’s “eternal optimism” had appealed to him. “Sadly the debate taking place in the Republican Party today is not focussed on that optimistic view of America,”&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walkers-full-statement-on-suspending-campaign-b99581511z1-328575531.html">Walker said</a>. “Instead it has drifted into personal attacks.&nbsp;In the end, I believe that the voters want to be for something, and not against someone. Instead of talking about how bad things are, we want to hear how we can make them better for everyone. We need to get back to the basics of our party.”</p> <p>Walker didn’t mention Trump by name—he didn’t have to. Like Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/11/rick-perry-drops-out-republican-presidential-election">dropped out of the race</a>&nbsp;two weeks ago, and like all the other regular politicians who are still in the contest, Walker&nbsp;suffered gravely from Trump’s ability to suck attention away from everybody else, save for those candidates who attacked Trump or were attacked by him.&nbsp;“I was sitting in church yesterday; the pastor’s words reminded me that the Bible is full of stories about people who were called to be leaders in unusual ways,” Walker went on. “Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field. With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately. I encourage other Republican Presidential candidates to consider doing the same, so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner.”</p> <p>In truth, Walker’s campaign was faltering even before mid-June, when Trump got&nbsp;into the race. Early on, a number of his statements had raised questions about his knowledge of national and international issues, and about whether he could make the jump from local to national politics. (While touting his foreign-policy credentials, for example, he appeared to equate pro-labor union demonstrators with members of <small>ISIS</small> and other deadly groups, remarking, “If I can take on a hundred thousand protesters, I can do the same across the world.”) In April and May, his poll numbers dropped back. Indeed, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scott-walkers-own-limitations-did-him-in/article/2572552">interview</a>&nbsp;with Byron York, of the&nbsp;<em>Washington Examiner</em>, Walker conceded that his rapid rise&nbsp;in the spring&nbsp;had caught him off guard.&nbsp;“We thought all along if we got in, it would be kind of this slow and steady, ‘Don’t worry about the other guys, just keep focused on moving forward,’&nbsp;and as candidates chose not to get in or fell off, we’d be in a position to make a compelling case to them,” he said.</p> <p>But if Walker made some rookie errors, Trump’s arrival on the scene raised the stakes and accelerated the pace for all of the candidates. What had seemed as though it would be a lengthy war of attrition turned into a popularity contest carried on in the full glare of the national media, with Trump stealing most of the attention. Walker, it turned out, wasn’t well suited to this type of politics. A somewhat stiff public speaker, he went largely unnoticed in the first televised debate. In the second, last week, he, at times, seemed to be reciting sound bites that he had rehearsed, and which weren’t very clever. For example, addressing Trump, he said that America couldn’t afford another “apprentice” in the White House, which raised the question of whether he actually knew what role the billionaire played in the long-running reality show. In a CNN poll carried out in the days after the debate, his support among likely Republican voters fell below one per cent, earning him&nbsp;a dreaded asterisk&nbsp;<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/20/rel10a.pdf">in the tabulated results</a>.</p> <p>Even before the CNN debate, Walker’s campaign appears to have been in worse trouble than most outsiders realized. As Trump’s poll numbers rose and fell, Walker’s ability to raise money, the lifeblood of any Presidential campaign—particularly one that was spending heavily to build a national infrastructure—was gravely undermined. Much of the cash that Walker had raised had already been spent, and, according to some reports, his staff members were having trouble attracting people to a fundraiser scheduled this week in New York. An&nbsp;article&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/21/scott-walker-quits-2016-presidential-race/">Times</a></em>, which broke the story of Walker’s withdrawal, said that “campaign bills were piling up, with some vendors complaining that they had not been paid on time.” The&nbsp;Milwaukee <em>Journal Sentinel</em>, Wisconsin’s largest newspaper,&nbsp;quoted a G.O.P. source&nbsp;who said, “If it wasn’t for cash flow, he’d still be here.”</p> <p>Rather than borrowing money and racking up big debts, Walker evidently accepted the verdict of the moneymen and debate viewers. Now that he’s&nbsp;done, the pundits are busy picking over his entrails, with the early consensus being that Senator Marco Rubio is likely to prove the primary beneficiary of his demise. Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster and Trump antagonist, remarked to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/scott-walker-is-dropping-out-of-republican-primary-race#.fnDD24e9A">BuzzFeed</a>&nbsp;that “a lot of Walker supporters had Rubio as their second choice, and a lot of Rubio supporters had Walker as their second choice.” Indeed, immediately after Walker’s announcement, some of his most prominent supporters in New Hampshire had&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wmur.com/politics/more-trouble-for-scott-walker-state-cochair-cliff-hurst-defects-to-marco-rubio/35397170">thrown their support</a>&nbsp;to Rubio.</p> <p>Walker’s foes, meanwhile, celebrated his departure. Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who called the Wisconsin Governor “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-13/walker-is-a-national-disgrace-afl-cio">a national disgrace</a>” on the day that Walker declared his candidacy,&nbsp;said in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-21/trumka-says-scott-walker-is-still-a-disgrace-">statement</a>:&nbsp;“Scott Walker is still a disgrace, just no longer national.” As for Trump, when the news broke that Walker was dropping out, he&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/646076422126223364">tweeted</a>&nbsp;graciously: “I got to know @ScottWalker well—he’s a very nice person and has a great future.” Later on Monday night, perhaps after watching Walker’s departure statement, Trump’s tone changed, as he referred on Twitter to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-third-party-independent_55e856cfe4b0aec9f35631a0">pledge</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;he and other candidates had&nbsp;signed, which commits them to supporting the G.O.P.’s eventual nominee. “What happened to The Pledge?

According to the rapturous response on the Internet, Carson’s remarks were a rebuke of President Obama—people saw Carson as an authentic black counterpoint to the President—but they were just as clearly a rejection of what he called the culture of “political correctness.” “The P.C. police are out in force,” he warned from the podium. “We’ve reached a point where people are afraid to say what they think because someone might be offended. People are afraid to say ‘Merry Christmas’ at Christmastime.”</p> <p>The concern among the burgeoning numbers of political-correctness critics—on both the left and right—is that the parameters of polite (or at least non-bigoted) discussion get in the way of truth-telling, leaving us with good feelings and palliative falsehoods. There is, however, a logical fallacy at play among many of these opponents, in their presumption that the validity of a statement exists in direct proportion to its capacity to offend.</p> <p>There are few anodyne truths in Ben Carson’s worldview. The decibel of the objections is evidence that he’s struck upon truth. A hit dog hollers, as Southerners say. When, this past Sunday, on “Meet the Press,” Carson voiced his opposition to the idea of a Muslim being elected President, he did so in the same calm, measured tones that attend almost all of his pronouncements. He spoke with the quiet confidence of a man convinced of the rectitude of his own position. Here is Carson responding to a question about whether voters should consider a candidate’s faith:</p> <blockquote word_count="42" data-wc="42"> <p>Carson went on to say that he believes that Islam is inconsistent with the Constitution, but that, inexplicably, he has no problem with Muslims serving in Congress.</p> <p>Carson’s position within the paranormal wing of the G.O.P. is perplexing for a number of reasons. Unlike Donald Trump, who is capable of making equally inflammatory and nativist comments, Carson’s intellectual accomplishments are indisputable.* He is a product of the most respected educational institutions in the United States and was once a foremost practitioner in a highly complex field of medicine. Yet his virtuoso abilities coexist with a loosely tethered relationship to other types of rational thought. Carson is a scientist who disavows evolution, a citizen who professes to be deeply concerned about democracy yet supports a religious litmus test for public office, and a physician who devoted himself to saving the lives of children but indulges the hypertensive claims of the anti-vaccine element. His bifurcated thinking calls to mind <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/12/james_watson_selling_nobel_prize_dna_structure_discoverer_s_history_of_racism.html">James Watson</a>, the Nobel winning co-discoverer of DNA, who spent years mouthing racist and sexist theories of human intelligence. On the stump, Carson seems like an object lesson in what happens when <small>STEM</small> majors don’t take enough courses in the humanities and social sciences.</p> <p>For reasons connected to his race, his education, and his exceptional talent, Carson at first carried an imprimatur of Serious Thought that the others in the crowded G.O.P. field did not. (Building a real-estate empire, winning a Senate seat, and serving as a corporate C.E.O. are impressive accomplishments, but they are literally not brain surgery.) But Carson’s duelling intellect and paranoia have led him to support untenable positions with minor qualifications. He panders by faint dissent. By stating that he believes that Islam is inconsistent with American democracy and that President Obama is a Christian born in the United States, he validates the substance of birtherism, just not this specific instance of it. When Carson was confronted, during the last Republican debate, with the question of whether vaccines cause autism, he stated that they did not but offered paranoiacs the nebulous chaser that we are giving children too many immunizations. The suggestion that vaccines have some nebulous danger essentially nullified the statement that preceded it.</p> <p>That the party responsible for the Southern strategy, the racist populism of the Reagan era, and the current age of voter suppression can count a black neurosurgeon among its most popular Presidential candidate is in itself a form of vaccination against charges of racism. It means one thing when a white billionaire taps into whites’ anxieties about cultural and economic displacement, and something else entirely when a black man from Detroit validates their conspiratorial fears about the Affordable Care Act. Or when, in an oblivious echo of the Dred Scott decision, an African-American states that entire segments of the population are irreconcilable with the Constitution. Carson’s is not a novel act. Five years ago, Juan Williams, a black journalist who covered civil rights and wrote a biography of Thurgood Marshall, stated that he <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130712737">felt fearful</a> when boarding a plane with Muslims.

But Carson appears to mean what he says, and there is a consistent market for his brand of exonerating racism, for bigotries so valid that even a brilliant black man endorses them.

I went to Africa with Henry Kissinger, Asia with Madeleine Albright, the Middle East with Colin Powell, and Europe with Condoleezza Rice, when they were Secretaries of State. But travelling with a Pope makes politicians seem small, and transitory. The Vatican, the world’s smallest state, is not even as large as the National Mall, in Washington, D.C. Yet in 1980, when John Paul II made his first trip to Brazil, a country almost the size of the United States, every Catholic Church was primed to simultaneously ring its bells the moment national radio announced that his plane had landed. We could hear some of them pealing when the airplane doors opened.</p> <p>John Paul II was a globe-trotter. He introduced the open Popemobile, and he spent more time in foreign slums than Presidential palaces. For more than a quarter of a century, he took the Church’s message to a hundred and twenty-nine countries, right up to the end, when he was hobbled by Parkinson’s disease. He was the first Pope to visit a synagogue, where he held a joint ceremony with a rabbi, in Hebrew; he later <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/johnpaul.html">left a note</a> in Jerusalem’s Western Wall, asking forgiveness for the Church’s persecution of Jews. He reached out to Muslims and called on them to forgive the centuries of wars, dating back to the Crusades. He quietly took off his shoes in the Umayyad Mosque, in Damascus, when he became the first Pope to pray in a <a href="https://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/popsyr.htm">mosque.</a></p> <p>John Paul was probably seen by more people in person than anyone in history. He established the tradition that Pope Francis has now embraced, after the cold and troubled papacy of Benedict XVI.</p> <p>In the eighties and nineties, I travelled with John Paul across four continents. The burly Pole, elected by the College of Cardinals on the eighth ballot, in 1978, could work the aisles of the papal plane as charismatically as he cupped the cheeks of a child or blessed a leper. Vatican officials tried to impose order, but the back of the plane often looked like a slow-moving rugby scrum as reporters and photographers scrambled to hear him while he worked his way from seat to seat.</p> <p>John Paul had a wry streak. On a flight from Alaska to Rome, he told a journalist, impishly, that he liked being Pope only “so-so.” On a tour of West Germany, when he went to the border with Communist Poland to demand freedom for his countrymen, I asked him if he really thought symbolic gestures made any difference. With a twinkle in his eye, he said, “Can’t you ask me a harder question?” He meant it. Flying out of Nagasaki, he told us of his anguish that two Catholics had been on the planes that unleashed the first atomic bombs. He had just ministered to long-forgotten victims wasting away from radiation more than thirty years later. I have a picture taken on our trip from Japan back to Rome, on Emperor Hirohito’s plane. The Pope had one arm on my shoulder and the other pointing at me as if to say, “For once, behave yourself.” He was actually talking about nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The papal plane is popularly referred to as Shepherd One, but the Pope actually flies commercial. We travelled from Rome on Alitalia, then picked up a national airline in each host country for the next leg. (Francis is flying American Airlines on his first U.S. trip.) The only thing truly papal about each flight was the yellow-and-white Vatican flag that popped out from a cockpit window on landing. We once took a Philippines Airline plane with “<small>HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD</small>” emblazoned on the side, in honor of its new Los Angeles route. That plane got so much press play—for the irony—that the airline had it painted over and replaced it with a huge “<small>VIVA IL PAPA</small>” for our six-day tour.</p> <p>The Pope was shrewdly deliberate even in his flight plans. We once flew back from Japan to Rome via Alaska to avoid overflying the Soviet Union. During his flights, John Paul always blessed each country and sent messages to its leader.</p> <p>As an agnostic, I often wondered whether the emotions unleashed in any Pope’s presence had an enduring impact, either on the lives of believers or on the state in which they lived. Even so, I came to see the world in a different way, and developed respect for the papal flourish.</p> <p>In a Rio slum, in 1980, I watched John Paul slog up a dirt road to a tiny hillside parish surrounded by shanties. He met with a couple of hundred residents. “A society that is not socially just, and does not intend to be, puts its own future in danger,” he <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/07/03/page/2/article/angered-by-brazilian-slums-pope-gives-ring-wins-hearts#text">said</a>. In an unscripted act, he slipped off his gold ring, a gift from Paul VI when he was elevated to cardinal, in 1967, and gave it to the parish. “The Church wants to be the church of the poor,” he said.</p> <p>In a sports stadium in São Paulo, during a cold rain, John Paul stood in front of more than a hundred thousand union workers, thrusting his fist in the air and shouting “<em>Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!</em>”—naming the Polish trade unions that mobilized to end Communist rule. “Power must never be used to protect the interests of one group against another,” he told his audience in the stadium. Christian principles required “freeing the world from domination of an oppressing order.” It was an invocation to act against Brazil’s military dictatorship.</p> <p>The results are mixed. The unions did play a dynamic role in ending the military dictatorship. But the Rio shantytown, Vidigal, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/02/world/slum-dwellers-in-rio-await-the-pope-s-return-visit-to-brazil-this-week.html?pagewanted=2">quadrupled</a> in size over the next two decades. Today, more than <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html">twenty per cent</a> of Brazilians still live in poverty.</p> <p>“I call his speeches time bombs,” a papal aide once told me. “They’re intended to transform. We just don’t know when they’ll explode.”</p> <p>I witnessed such an explosion up close once, during the Pope’s 1981 trip to the Philippines. I was the papal-pool reporter for the meeting between John Paul and President Ferdinand Marcos. Everyone who attended, even the press, was required to wear the styles favored by the palace—all white. We were offered bolts of cloth to have them made. I had to wear a long dress with poufy pointed sleeves that made me look like a rocket about to take off.</p> <p>The Pope had repeatedly delayed the trip over differences with Marcos, who had proposed building an opulent basilica for the visit. John Paul wanted none of it; he showed up only after martial law was lifted. At a nationally broadcast reception, with Marcos sitting on a thronelike chair next to him, John Paul openly rebuked the President. “Even in exceptional situations that may at times arise, one can never justify any violation of the fundamental dignity of the human person or of the basic rights that safeguard this dignity.” I can still remember the fury on Marcos’s face. The Pope refused to confer with him again or give a mass at Malacañang Palace.</p> <p>First Lady Imelda Marcos tried to one-up the pontiff. She flew ahead to our other stops to be there to greet him, kiss his ring—and be photographed. On the way back to Rome, we asked John Paul what he thought of her antics. He was sunburned from the intense island-hopping trip. He smiled, and said, “If she comes to Mass, I certainly can’t throw her out.”</p> <p>It was on that trip that the Pope quietly signalled permission for the rare use of the pulpit, under the guidance of Cardinal Jaime Sin, to give voice to opposition among the largest Catholic population in Asia. Five years later, the People Power Revolution forced Marcos from power.</p> <p>In those early years of his papacy, John Paul’s exhortations carried an unambiguous message about the inherent right to human fulfillment. He confronted dictators in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, as well as Communists in Eastern Europe, with that powerful, stubborn persona. Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, once <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/02/11/pope-benedict-fell-short-of-john-paul-iis-legacy-as-a-global-political-leader/">reflected</a> that the end of the Cold War would have been “impossible” without the Pope. The papacy, however, is an impossible balancing act between the divine and the human—and the gap between them is enormous. In the later years of his papacy, John Paul’s message shifted. I travelled with him again in the mid-nineties, when he made his first trip to what had been the Soviet Union. His mother was of Lithuanian descent; she had died when he was nine. Vilnius was our first stop. With Communism in demise, the Vicar of Christ began a campaign against capitalism. He was angry about its excesses and inequities, disdainful of materialism, and contemptuous of insatiable consumer appetites. It was a theme that defined the last decade of his papacy.</p> <p>“The needs from which [socialism] had historically arisen were real and serious,” he said later, in Latvia. “The situation of exploitation to which inhumane capitalism had subjected the proletariat since the beginning of industrialized society was indeed an evil. This was Marxism’s basic kernel of truth, which enabled it to present itself as an attractive reality to Western society.”</p> <p>Having lived under both Fascism and Communism, John Paul had lofty and somewhat naïve visions about creating a just society—if only bad ideologies failed and bad leaders were replaced. In the end, that message never quite resonated. He had too much faith that his flock was willing to forfeit individual good—and do unto others—for the sake of the community. His moral authority had less impact on the subject of greed. I often wondered whether he was discouraged at the end of his life.</p> <p>But John Paul probably still left a more profound impression than almost any secular politician of his era. And the new guy seems headed down the same track.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>I flew on Air Force One when Bill Clinton made the first Presidential trip to Vietnam after the war.

Vatican officials tried to impose order, but the back of the plane often looked like a slow-moving rugby scrum as reporters and photographers scrambled to hear him while he worked his way from seat to seat.</p> <p>John Paul had a wry streak. On a flight from Alaska to Rome, he told a journalist, impishly, that he liked being Pope only “so-so.” On a tour of West Germany, when he went to the border with Communist Poland to demand freedom for his countrymen, I asked him if he really thought symbolic gestures made any difference. With a twinkle in his eye, he said, “Can’t you ask me a harder question?” He meant it. Flying out of Nagasaki, he told us of his anguish that two Catholics had been on the planes that unleashed the first atomic bombs. He had just ministered to long-forgotten victims wasting away from radiation more than thirty years later. I have a picture taken on our trip from Japan back to Rome, on Emperor Hirohito’s plane. The Pope had one arm on my shoulder and the other pointing at me as if to say, “For once, behave yourself.” He was actually talking about nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The papal plane is popularly referred to as Shepherd One, but the Pope actually flies commercial. We travelled from Rome on Alitalia, then picked up a national airline in each host country for the next leg. (Francis is flying American Airlines on his first U.S. trip.) The only thing truly papal about each flight was the yellow-and-white Vatican flag that popped out from a cockpit window on landing. We once took a Philippines Airline plane with “<small>HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD</small>” emblazoned on the side, in honor of its new Los Angeles route. That plane got so much press play—for the irony—that the airline had it painted over and replaced it with a huge “<small>VIVA IL PAPA</small>” for our six-day tour.</p> <p>The Pope was shrewdly deliberate even in his flight plans. We once flew back from Japan to Rome via Alaska to avoid overflying the Soviet Union. During his flights, John Paul always blessed each country and sent messages to its leader.</p> <p>As an agnostic, I often wondered whether the emotions unleashed in any Pope’s presence had an enduring impact, either on the lives of believers or on the state in which they lived. Even so, I came to see the world in a different way, and developed respect for the papal flourish.</p> <p>In a Rio slum, in 1980, I watched John Paul slog up a dirt road to a tiny hillside parish surrounded by shanties. He met with a couple of hundred residents. “A society that is not socially just, and does not intend to be, puts its own future in danger,” he <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/07/03/page/2/article/angered-by-brazilian-slums-pope-gives-ring-wins-hearts#text">said</a>. In an unscripted act, he slipped off his gold ring, a gift from Paul VI when he was elevated to cardinal, in 1967, and gave it to the parish. “The Church wants to be the church of the poor,” he said.</p> <p>In a sports stadium in São Paulo, during a cold rain, John Paul stood in front of more than a hundred thousand union workers, thrusting his fist in the air and shouting “<em>Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!</em>”—naming the Polish trade unions that mobilized to end Communist rule. “Power must never be used to protect the interests of one group against another,” he told his audience in the stadium. Christian principles required “freeing the world from domination of an oppressing order.” It was an invocation to act against Brazil’s military dictatorship.</p> <p>The results are mixed. The unions did play a dynamic role in ending the military dictatorship. But the Rio shantytown, Vidigal, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/02/world/slum-dwellers-in-rio-await-the-pope-s-return-visit-to-brazil-this-week.html?pagewanted=2">quadrupled</a> in size over the next two decades. Today, more than <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html">twenty per cent</a> of Brazilians still live in poverty.</p> <p>“I call his speeches time bombs,” a papal aide once told me. “They’re intended to transform. We just don’t know when they’ll explode.”</p> <p>I witnessed such an explosion up close once, during the Pope’s 1981 trip to the Philippines. I was the papal-pool reporter for the meeting between John Paul and President Ferdinand Marcos. Everyone who attended, even the press, was required to wear the styles favored by the palace—all white. We were offered bolts of cloth to have them made. I had to wear a long dress with poufy pointed sleeves that made me look like a rocket about to take off.</p> <p>The Pope had repeatedly delayed the trip over differences with Marcos, who had proposed building an opulent basilica for the visit. John Paul wanted none of it; he showed up only after martial law was lifted. At a nationally broadcast reception, with Marcos sitting on a thronelike chair next to him, John Paul openly rebuked the President. “Even in exceptional situations that may at times arise, one can never justify any violation of the fundamental dignity of the human person or of the basic rights that safeguard this dignity.” I can still remember the fury on Marcos’s face. The Pope refused to confer with him again or give a mass at Malacañang Palace.</p> <p>First Lady Imelda Marcos tried to one-up the pontiff. She flew ahead to our other stops to be there to greet him, kiss his ring—and be photographed. On the way back to Rome, we asked John Paul what he thought of her antics. He was sunburned from the intense island-hopping trip. He smiled, and said, “If she comes to Mass, I certainly can’t throw her out.”</p> <p>It was on that trip that the Pope quietly signalled permission for the rare use of the pulpit, under the guidance of Cardinal Jaime Sin, to give voice to opposition among the largest Catholic population in Asia. Five years later, the People Power Revolution forced Marcos from power.</p> <p>In those early years of his papacy, John Paul’s exhortations carried an unambiguous message about the inherent right to human fulfillment. He confronted dictators in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, as well as Communists in Eastern Europe, with that powerful, stubborn persona. Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, once <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/02/11/pope-benedict-fell-short-of-john-paul-iis-legacy-as-a-global-political-leader/">reflected</a> that the end of the Cold War would have been “impossible” without the Pope. The papacy, however, is an impossible balancing act between the divine and the human—and the gap between them is enormous. In the later years of his papacy, John Paul’s message shifted. I travelled with him again in the mid-nineties, when he made his first trip to what had been the Soviet Union. His mother was of Lithuanian descent; she had died when he was nine. Vilnius was our first stop. With Communism in demise, the Vicar of Christ began a campaign against capitalism. He was angry about its excesses and inequities, disdainful of materialism, and contemptuous of insatiable consumer appetites. It was a theme that defined the last decade of his papacy.</p> <p>“The needs from which [socialism] had historically arisen were real and serious,” he said later, in Latvia. “The situation of exploitation to which inhumane capitalism had subjected the proletariat since the beginning of industrialized society was indeed an evil. This was Marxism’s basic kernel of truth, which enabled it to present itself as an attractive reality to Western society.”</p> <p>Having lived under both Fascism and Communism, John Paul had lofty and somewhat naïve visions about creating a just society—if only bad ideologies failed and bad leaders were replaced. In the end, that message never quite resonated. He had too much faith that his flock was willing to forfeit individual good—and do unto others—for the sake of the community. His moral authority had less impact on the subject of greed. I often wondered whether he was discouraged at the end of his life.</p> <p>But John Paul probably still left a more profound impression than almost any secular politician of his era. And the new guy seems headed down the same track.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

I’ve been around the block—literally, I’ve been around that block between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets between First Avenue and A <em>twice</em>. It takes a long-ass time.</p> <p>Everyone knows my neighborhood has the highest concentration of decent food in this city. I’ve got cousins over near N.Y.U., and they say St. Mark’s Place has great Japanese, but that ain’t my speed. I’d been hearing about the First Avenue Pizza Gauntlet ever since my ear canals opened up, two weeks after I was born in the tunnel under the East River. I came here for the pizza.</p> <p>First of all, you can forget about Artichoke Basille’s—the pizza there might actually be worse than that Famous 99 Cent crap. Just don’t even bother. Looking south from Fourteenth, you have Vinny Vincenz on your right. Vinny’s is unbeatable in every way, from the tin walls to the hand-painted wooden sign. Also, it serves beer, which means increased potential for dropped slices. To your left, there’s Joey Pepperoni. It’s a real budget joint: dollar slices, combos with soda, that kinda thing.</p> <p>If you have the cojones to cross Thirteenth Street, you’ll be rewarded with Luzzo’s and Papa John’s on opposite sides of the street. Luzzo’s oven is coal-fired, but lemme tell you, from where I’m crouching, the whole crust mania is getting old. Plus, everyone takes his leftovers home in a box, loudly saying he’ll eat it for lunch the next day, but everyone ends up scarfing it before bed. I’ve had way more luck over the last few weeks with Papa John’s, because <em>nobody</em> walks in off the street to buy those slices.</p> <p>Finally, tucked away on Twelfth Street you have Motorino—this is the real deal. It’s the kind of place where, if you take a lady rat, the staff will suggest a fizzy-red-wine pairing.

(I’m skeptical, but with those full windows that open onto the street, there is easy access.)</p> <p>You know what never happens, though? Ever? No human in the history of New York has ever thrown away a fully intact, unblemished plain slice. Any old rat can nab a crust, sure—that’s easy. And plenty of drunk idiots have left whole globs of mozzarella and mushroom and pepperoni in their wake as they made their way home from the bar. Did you know that some people don’t even use the plates?</p> <p>Anyway, this afternoon, there I was, minding my own business, when I caught a glimpse of the Holy Grail: a perfect isosceles triangle, gilded in golden grease, and slightly congealed. I could tell it was from Vinny’s—I can smell that sauce from ten feet away. You already know what happened next, because it’s all over the goddam news.

This epochal event took place in the nineteen-sixties, at the height of Bogart mania. The sound failed—O calamity!—in the final scene. But the movie did not play in silence. As one, the audience filled in the dialogue: “Major Strasser has been shot. Round up the usual suspects.” And also: “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”</p> <p>This may be no more than a story—a half-true story—but I felt that I was part of an audience like that on Saturday night, at a screening of “The Godfather.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&amp;amp;v=6ksZT_JQR0I">The New York Philharmonic</a>, conducted by Justin Freer, played all the music (by Nino Rota and others) as a digitized version of the movie was projected above it in Avery Fisher Hall. Aesthetically, as I will explain, the evening was no better than a mixed success, but spiritually it was a triumph. The audience knew the movie intimately and enjoyed watching it together in a big theatre, and, judging by their response, they could have easily filled in missing lines if there had been any. (“May their first child be a masculine child.” And the darkly funny—in context, after a murder—“Take the cannoli.”) The place was packed, mainly with people in early middle age, many of whom probably got to know the movie from revivals and DVDs. (The event will be repeated tonight, September 21st.)</p> <p>“The Godfather” is forty-three years old. I first saw it at a pre-opening screening in March, 1972, either at the Criterion or the Rivoli, two of the many demolished movie palaces in Times Square. As a critic, I was a beginner. The more established critics had seen it earlier, and the word was out that it was astonishing. As the lights went down, a tall, slender woman, her head covered with a scarf, sat down next to me. Until the end of the movie, I had no idea who it was. No doubt Faye Dunaway was as much impressed as anyone else. She was certainly quiet enough. Her own great crime film, “Chinatown,” directed by Roman Polanski, came out two years later.</p> <p>On Saturday, as people walked into Avery Fisher (soon to be David Geffen) Hall, there were the expected jokes from an excited crowd: “I guess they shoot you if you show up late.” Paul Sorvino, massive and affable, appeared onstage and offered the audience the uncertain pleasure of hearing him sing “O Sole Mio,” which, Italian origins apart, had no obvious relation to the business at hand. Yet Sorvino’s presence established a movie linkage. As he noted, his own mafia masterpiece, “Goodfellas,” directed by Martin Scorsese, would celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its première on September 19th.</p> <p>The music began—the haunting main theme, played by solo trumpet, but in a tempo not quite as slow as that on the movie track itself. Freer, the conductor, has a definite feeling for the lilt and ease of Rota’s work—not just the lovely, insinuating, and powerful music Rota composed but the forties-swing-band pastiche that appears as Tom Hagen goes to Los Angeles to make the studio boss Jack Woltz an offer he can’t refuse, or the slightly squared-off rhythms of the bored town wedding band that plays as Michael Corleone marries Apollonia in Sicily. The big shock in hearing the entire score is realizing how little, relatively speaking, there is of it. The music appears at crucial moments—stunningly, when Michael drops the gun in the restaurant after shooting Sollozzo and McCluskey, and we realize that his fate, to be a gangster, his father’s son, is settled forever. And the blooming of Michael’s love for Apollonia in Sicily is accompanied by a full-blooded romantic melody. But for long stretches the dialogue stands alone. The Philharmonic is a mighty instrument, and Freer had the orchestra playing softly and with great finesse—exquisite harp, guitar, and woodwind solos, the strings murmuring or rustling, except during the love music. Most of the time, the violinists sat still and looked at the screen.</p> <p>But in many ways, the evening was awkward. The orchestra sat on the stage, the screen behind and above. But there was an obvious problem, and it should have been avoided. The lamps over the scores of the hundred or so musicians literally blanched out the bottom quarter of the screen. The up-from-black opening (“I believe in America”) didn’t have its usual effect, because the screen was never black. Throughout the movie, there was simply too much light reflected onto the screen for Gordon Willis’s extraordinary cinematography to work as well as it does in a darkened theatre or even at home, on a TV screen. After all, Francis Ford Coppola and Willis shot a lot of “The Godfather” at night, or in semi-darkened rooms where people sit and plot. When the movie shifts to Sicily for the scenes of Michael’s exile, the entire screen was filled with sun and light, and the image was much improved—the light from below didn’t show. In all, these movie-and-orchestra events would work much better in a theatre with a pit; alternately, the hall’s managers could have taken out the first six or seven rows in front of the stage, as it does for summer concerts, and put the Philharmonic there, on the floor, well below and in front of the screen.</p> <p>But that’s not all. As a visual experience, the digital transfer, reconstructed, apparently, with great effort, is simply not equal to the film in a fresh print. The image had that tense, flattened, edged quality that digital still has—the slight outlining, the slight shallowness. Sorry, this is not nostalgia for a vanquished technology; it’s true, and anyone who has seen “The Godfather” <em>film</em> will say the same. Finally, the dialogue track, for some reason, sounded scratchy and at times indistinct, which it certainly doesn’t at home in a standard DVD transfer. (Perhaps the audience needed to fill in the dialogue after all.) Is it possible that Avery Fisher Hall doesn’t have the right speakers for movies?</p> <p>As for the film itself, it felt as devastating as ever. I noticed yet again how intimate it is, how domestic, with brothers, sisters, children, wives, and pets in so many scenes. And how ceremonious, too—not just in Brando’s majestic performance as the Don but, literally, in two weddings, a formal marriage proposal, a summit meeting, a funeral. Coppola and Mario Puzo, adapting Puzo’s novel, move the Corleone family upward, into money and power, and downward, into corruption, intimidation, murder, destruction of the family in order to save the family. The formality—the insistence on rules, boundaries, respect—is hilariously at odds with the chaos and violence that rages all the time.</p> <p>Certain oddities and quirks still seemed fresh—James Caan’s square-shouldered strut as Sonny Corleone, Brando’s silent shrug after hearing that an enemy has been destroyed, John Marley’s hyper-emphatic performance as Woltz explaining why Johnny Fontane will never appear in the studio’s war picture. (Fontane ruined a studio starlet, “the best piece if ass I’ve ever had, and I’ve had ’em all over the world.”) Marley’s scream of horror when he wakes up soaked in stallion’s blood, remains, after all these years, the ultimate movie scream, just as “The Godfather” remains the ultimate postwar American movie. Seeing the movie communally unified its many strands. The more complicated “Godfather, Part II,” with its shifting planes of time, came next, and in some ways the later film is the greater work. But “The Godfather,” in itself, is perfect. It would be nice, however, if there were some way of experiencing it in all its glory.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>One night in Harvard Square, at a showing of “Casablanca” at the Brattle revival house, the sound system failed.

Its director, Carol Bash, happily departs from the lockstep of chronology to emphasize Mary Lou Williams’s latter-day musical achievements, introducing the mature musician in 1980, the year before her death, at the age of seventy-one, performing splendidly for a university audience, before sketching the launch of Williams’s musical career while still a teen-ager in the nineteen-twenties.</p> <p>The life that Bash outlines, in a mere hour and ten minutes, is exactly what Williams herself knew it to be—a personal history of jazz. The director cites Williams’s proud but apt assertion of her own place in the musical life of her time—“I’m the only living musician that was there when each era started”—and includes some snippets of performance that display the grand artistic import of Williams’s assertion. As the movie makes clear, she was more than just there—she was one of the key developers of the musical ideas of these eras, and she did more than just remain up-to-date; from era to era, she surpassed herself.</p> <p>The point is one of a stark historical clarity: the rarity of stylistic change over the course of a jazz musician’s career. Louis Armstrong, for instance, the seminal soloist of the art form, more or less ended his musical development while still in his twenties, and held to the same style from the time of his heroic recordings made between 1925 and 1930 through to the end of his life, in 1971. Duke Ellington, a peerless composer as well as a great pianist, reached a stylistic apogee in the early nineteen-forties and revealed little trace of new trends over the next thirty years. Among the greats, there’s only Coleman Hawkins, who played with Fletcher Henderson in the nineteen-twenties, with Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis in the nineteen-forties, with John Coltrane in the nineteen-fifties, and with Sonny Rollins in the nineteen-sixties; there’s Davis himself, who was in a state of perpetual revolution from the mid-forties through the mid-seventies; and Coltrane went further in a mere decade, from the mid-fifties through his death, in 1967, than any jazz musician ever had.</p> <p>But Williams, in continuing to outdo herself, also outdid these heroes of her time in several crucial respects: she played better in her sixties than she ever did, reaching an artistic fulfillment in the nineteen-seventies that was due to the triple coincidence of external circumstances of the music world, those of her personal life, and those of her own creative evolution. Williams didn’t just change, she grew; the brilliant ideas that were present in her earlier work expanded on contact with new musical realms, and she found herself doubling back on prior resistance to the strongest and most difficult new styles to incorporate both their freedom and their complexity into her playing.</p> <p>If Louis Armstrong had stopped performing after 1930, or Duke Ellington had stopped performing after 1942, their places atop jazz history would be no less secure. But Mary Lou Williams, who created much great music throughout her life, did her most powerful, distinctive, personal, and innovative work in her sixties. In this regard, she’s unique in the history of jazz. In the music that she performed in the last decade of her life, in solos, duets, and trios, her originality and her passion, as well as the depth of her experience, come through in an awe-inspiring, hands-on rush of pent-up and long-gestating creative energy.</p> <p>As Bash emphasizes, Williams’s musical career rose to the forefront of jazz when she was twenty, due to her association with Andy Kirk’s band. That’s where her first husband, John Williams, played (they married when she was in her teens). She greatly impressed Kirk musically, but Kirk didn’t like the idea of having a woman in the band; she was relegated to the role of a replacement pianist, but happened to be called upon to play when the band auditioned for the record-company executive Jack Kapp. The story that Bash tells of her change in fortunes is horrific: the band reached Chicago to record for Kapp, but Williams was left behind; Kapp insisted that the band couldn’t record without her; Kirk sent for her. In the train from Kansas City to St. Louis en route to Chicago, she was raped by the conductor. She then arrived in Chicago and went straight from the train to the recording session, where, upon arrival in the studio, Kapp tapped her to play solo, and she unleashed a torrent of musical invention, “Nite Life.” Interviewed by Bash on-camera, the historian Farah Jasmine Griffin says of that exuberant performance that “we don’t hear it thinking of trauma” and adds, “Music, for Mary Lou, is really a documentation of the triumph over the trauma.”</p> <p>Of trauma, there was plenty—those that were due to being a woman; those that were due to being black; and those that arose from the life of a musician, of an artist. Born in Atlanta, Williams moved to Pittsburgh as a child, and her family traded the legal terror regime of Jim Crow for the unchallenged practical discrimination of the North. But Williams’s teachers recognized her musical genius and helped to foster it. Her home life, and especially her relationship with her mother, were troubled, and she joined a travelling band both to make money and to get away.</p> <p>Bash deftly outlines the effort that it took for her to escape from the “clowning” of show business and take her music seriously, and aptly highlights the cauldron of Williams’s musical innovation—the band’s residence in Kansas City. They had few commercial prospects, but the city was a thriving musical hub, and Williams played constantly alongside the greats of the time, including Hawkins, Lester Young, and Count Basie, and in the presence of the adolescent Charlie Parker, with whom she’d play in New York twenty years later.</p> <p>“Mary Lou Williams: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOxIyFe9g0o">The Lady Who Swings the Band</a>” gets its subtitle from a composition by Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin, in honor of Williams, that the Kirk band recorded in 1936. Her association with that band ended in 1942, though, because she found its popular styles musically limiting. Bash details Williams’s move to New York, her prominence at Café Society, her passionate devotion to musical innovation and to the innovators themselves—and the trouble she faced due to her musical seriousness, her gender, and her dark skin (light-skinned black artists found a much easier time of gaining acceptance).</p> <p>The movie’s prime virtue is its panoply of voices, including interviews with the musicians Hank Jones, Billy Taylor, Carmen Lundy, and Geri Allen (who is also filmed giving a splendid performance of Williams’s composition “Lonely Moments”); the historians Gary Giddins, Griffin, and Tammy Kernodle, and her friends Johnnie Garry and Gray Weingarten. There’s also a generous offering of clips of Williams in performance, both on record and on film, and Bash also includes citations from Williams, spoken on the soundtrack by Alfre Woodard (often accompanied by an unfortunate skein of boilerplate stock footage; it would have been better simply to see Woodard at a microphone).</p> <p>Bash sketches the romantic complications that Williams got herself into, but there are many important aspects of Williams’s life that the movie leaves out, such as her habit of gambling and the resulting money troubles that played a big role in her decision to leave the United States for Europe, in 1952, and the family troubles that hounded her to the end of her life. (I’d recommend Linda Dahl’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/dahl-glory.html">superb biography</a> of Williams, “Morning Glory,” for a more detailed view.) There are also some fascinating musical byways that Bash doesn’t take up, such as the small groups of women musicians with whom Williams recorded in the mid-forties. The recordings are beautiful—Williams made particular use of the groups’ distinctive texture—but for Williams herself, they were the source of conflict and dissatisfaction. She struggled for acceptance as a musician and preferred not to be pigeonholed as a woman musician—and, as Dahl writes, this led to conflict late in her career, in 1978, when she appeared at a “Women’s Jazz Festival” but publicly repudiated its very premise.</p> <p>What Bash outlines, and what Dahl details, is a musical career that, in its very historicity, went to the forefront of modernity. From the earliest days of her career, Williams was self-consciously looking backward as she looked ahead. Even as she performed music by Jelly Roll Morton and borrowed arranging styles from Don Redman, she created swing riffs that became the basis for compositions by Thelonious Monk and other modernists. She worked with the short-lived modernist pianist and composer Herbie Nichols as early as 1951 and performed with Parker at that time, becoming a heroine of bebop even as she quickly tired of what she perceived as its theoretical rigidity. Her next decade and a half of musical exploration was marked by a historic movement; in 1955, she recorded an album called “A Keyboard History”; she sought to include popular stylings of rock and rhythm and blues in her playing in 1959.</p> <p>When Williams had a gig at a New York jazz club in 1964, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1964/05/02/out-here-again">Whitney Balliett profiled her for <em>The New Yorker</em>,</a> writing that “Miss Williams’ present work, I discovered at the Hickory House, is an instructive history of jazz piano—a kind of one-woman retrospective of an entire movement.” Her embodiment of jazz history is all the more remarkable inasmuch as she had experienced that history in real time. At that very moment, the world of movies was undergoing its own renewal as a result of creative historicism: young French critics and their American acolytes, including Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, and Brian De Palma, were advancing the art of movies by recuperating and reconfiguring the styles of the past. Williams, amazingly, re-created a history that she helped to create. It was a far mightier task, because it also entailed an undoing of that past, a musical self-criticism in performance. The psychological and emotional complexity of her experience is mighty and terrifying; it’s reflected in the turbulence and the passion of her life. It wouldn’t be going too far to call Mary Lou Williams the living embodiment of a New Wave in jazz.</p> <p>I’ve put together a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/richardalanbrody/playlist/2ryer7Bp8kO9mZc5X0rv5G">Spotify playlist</a> of some of my favorite recordings by Williams.

Its director, Carol Bash, happily departs from the lockstep of chronology to emphasize Mary Lou Williams’s latter-day musical achievements, introducing the mature musician in 1980, the year before her death, at the age of seventy-one, performing splendidly for a university audience, before sketching the launch of Williams’s musical career while still a teen-ager in the nineteen-twenties.</p> <p>The life that Bash outlines, in a mere hour and ten minutes, is exactly what Williams herself knew it to be—a personal history of jazz. The director cites Williams’s proud but apt assertion of her own place in the musical life of her time—“I’m the only living musician that was there when each era started”—and includes some snippets of performance that display the grand artistic import of Williams’s assertion. As the movie makes clear, she was more than just there—she was one of the key developers of the musical ideas of these eras, and she did more than just remain up-to-date; from era to era, she surpassed herself.</p> <p>The point is one of a stark historical clarity: the rarity of stylistic change over the course of a jazz musician’s career. Louis Armstrong, for instance, the seminal soloist of the art form, more or less ended his musical development while still in his twenties, and held to the same style from the time of his heroic recordings made between 1925 and 1930 through to the end of his life, in 1971. Duke Ellington, a peerless composer as well as a great pianist, reached a stylistic apogee in the early nineteen-forties and revealed little trace of new trends over the next thirty years. Among the greats, there’s only Coleman Hawkins, who played with Fletcher Henderson in the nineteen-twenties, with Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis in the nineteen-forties, with John Coltrane in the nineteen-fifties, and with Sonny Rollins in the nineteen-sixties; there’s Davis himself, who was in a state of perpetual revolution from the mid-forties through the mid-seventies; and Coltrane went further in a mere decade, from the mid-fifties through his death, in 1967, than any jazz musician ever had.</p> <p>But Williams, in continuing to outdo herself, also outdid these heroes of her time in several crucial respects: she played better in her sixties than she ever did, reaching an artistic fulfillment in the nineteen-seventies that was due to the triple coincidence of external circumstances of the music world, those of her personal life, and those of her own creative evolution. Williams didn’t just change, she grew; the brilliant ideas that were present in her earlier work expanded on contact with new musical realms, and she found herself doubling back on prior resistance to the strongest and most difficult new styles to incorporate both their freedom and their complexity into her playing.</p> <p>If Louis Armstrong had stopped performing after 1930, or Duke Ellington had stopped performing after 1942, their places atop jazz history would be no less secure. But Mary Lou Williams, who created much great music throughout her life, did her most powerful, distinctive, personal, and innovative work in her sixties. In this regard, she’s unique in the history of jazz. In the music that she performed in the last decade of her life, in solos, duets, and trios, her originality and her passion, as well as the depth of her experience, come through in an awe-inspiring, hands-on rush of pent-up and long-gestating creative energy.</p> <p>As Bash emphasizes, Williams’s musical career rose to the forefront of jazz when she was twenty, due to her association with Andy Kirk’s band. That’s where her first husband, John Williams, played (they married when she was in her teens). She greatly impressed Kirk musically, but Kirk didn’t like the idea of having a woman in the band; she was relegated to the role of a replacement pianist, but happened to be called upon to play when the band auditioned for the record-company executive Jack Kapp. The story that Bash tells of her change in fortunes is horrific: the band reached Chicago to record for Kapp, but Williams was left behind; Kapp insisted that the band couldn’t record without her; Kirk sent for her. In the train from Kansas City to St. Louis en route to Chicago, she was raped by the conductor. She then arrived in Chicago and went straight from the train to the recording session, where, upon arrival in the studio, Kapp tapped her to play solo, and she unleashed a torrent of musical invention, “Nite Life.” Interviewed by Bash on-camera, the historian Farah Jasmine Griffin says of that exuberant performance that “we don’t hear it thinking of trauma” and adds, “Music, for Mary Lou, is really a documentation of the triumph over the trauma.”</p> <p>Of trauma, there was plenty—those that were due to being a woman; those that were due to being black; and those that arose from the life of a musician, of an artist. Born in Atlanta, Williams moved to Pittsburgh as a child, and her family traded the legal terror regime of Jim Crow for the unchallenged practical discrimination of the North. But Williams’s teachers recognized her musical genius and helped to foster it. Her home life, and especially her relationship with her mother, were troubled, and she joined a travelling band both to make money and to get away.</p> <p>Bash deftly outlines the effort that it took for her to escape from the “clowning” of show business and take her music seriously, and aptly highlights the cauldron of Williams’s musical innovation—the band’s residence in Kansas City. They had few commercial prospects, but the city was a thriving musical hub, and Williams played constantly alongside the greats of the time, including Hawkins, Lester Young, and Count Basie, and in the presence of the adolescent Charlie Parker, with whom she’d play in New York twenty years later.</p> <p>“Mary Lou Williams: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOxIyFe9g0o">The Lady Who Swings the Band</a>” gets its subtitle from a composition by Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin, in honor of Williams, that the Kirk band recorded in 1936.

The left-wing Syriza party is again forming a coalition with a small nationalist party, Independent Greeks; together, the two parties will have a small majority in parliament.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/greeces-necessary-election">calling a snap election</a>&nbsp;shortly after he did a U-turn and accepted a third austerity-packed bailout from&nbsp;Greece’s creditors,&nbsp;Tsipras&nbsp;took a political gamble.&nbsp;It paid off in&nbsp;Sunday’s&nbsp;elections, when&nbsp;Syriza won slightly more than thirty-five per cent of the votes cast, practically the same percentage it gained in the January election that brought it to power.&nbsp;With&nbsp;some of Syriza’s more radical representatives having defected to a new party that failed to win any seats, Tsipras should also theoretically be in a stronger position to push through&nbsp;a series of economic reforms that Greece’s creditors have demanded, including an effective raise in the retirement age and measures designed to make more people pay taxes.</p> <p>Still,&nbsp;Tsipras and his colleagues face a monumental challenge—not only in implementing the terms of the bailout but in getting Greece’s stricken economy growing again. Unless the country can somehow engineer a recovery, it won’t be very long before it faces yet another financial crisis.</p> <p>Let’s start with the task of carrying out the economic reforms, which may be the lesser&nbsp;of the difficulties&nbsp;facing Tsipras.&nbsp;Back in July, faced with an imminent collapse in the banking system, he reluctantly signed on to a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/12/memorandum-understanding-what-exactly-has-greece-signed-up-for">new bailout</a>, worth close to a hundred billion dollars, that laid out a series of steps Greece has to take before the money is disbursed. Even now, Tsipras hasn’t exactly embraced this agreement. After the result of the election became clear, he said that it had given him a “clear mandate to carry on fighting inside and outside our country to uphold the pride of our people.” But he didn’t mention anything about pension cuts, privatization, or other unpopular reforms.</p> <p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=991061">research note</a>&nbsp;released on Monday, the Wall Street ratings agency Fitch said that the Greek government’s “ownership” of the reform program “is likely to remain less than whole-hearted, and its negotiating stance unpredictable.”&nbsp;That seems about right. At the same time that the new Syriza government&nbsp;sets about&nbsp;passing a series of laws designed to reduce the budget deficit and open up Greece’s economy to competition—for example, by&nbsp;deregulating the energy market, scrapping price controls for medicines, and selling state-owned ports and airports to private companies—it will be busy recapitalizing the country’s banks, which saw big withdrawals of capital during the spring and early summer. As in other countries that have been down this path, the sight of big banks receiving large infusions of public money while budget cuts are being introduced elsewhere is likely to prove toxic politically.</p> <p>Tsipras doesn’t have much choice, however. Since his government imposed emergency capital controls&nbsp;in late June, placing strict limits on how much cash Greeks can withdraw from banks, liquidity has been in short supply, and some parts of the economy have been reduced&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/business/international/trading-meat-for-tires-as-bartering-economy-grows-in-greece.html">to barter</a>. To restore confidence in the banking system, and to get credit flowing again, the banks’&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/05/us-eurozone-greece-banks-idUSKCN0QA1QX20150805">balance sheets will have to be reinforced</a>, and that is where a good portion of the bailout funds will be directed. As for the rest of the money, much of it will go toward interest payments on Greece’s existing mountain of debt—i.e., it will go straight back to the country’s creditors, who, at this stage, consist largely of other European Union countries, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>This won’t be popular, either. The key issue&nbsp;is whether introducing structural reforms, stabilizing the banking system, and, possibly, beginning negotiations to receive debt relief will be sufficient to restore lasting growth to the Greek economy, which has enormous stocks of unused resources. Which brings us back to Tsipras’s larger economic challenge.&nbsp;To be sure, the country has a number of serious problems that are crimping its long-term prospects, such as crony capitalism, corruption, and tax evasion. But the immediate task is to put an end to a depression that has seen Greece’s G.D.P. fall by a quarter, the unemployment rate reach twenty-six per cent (more than fifty per cent among the young), and the number of people experiencing severe deprivation—meaning that they can’t afford to buy basic items, such as food and shelter—rising&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33507802">to about twenty per cent.</a></p> <p>In the long term, Greece needs structural reforms, but in the short term it needs to get back to work. To bring that about,&nbsp;the country needs higher levels of demand throughout the economy. But where is that extra demand going to come from?</p> <p>Not from the government sector. While Greece is crying out for a Keynesian fiscal stimulus or a Friedmanite “helicopter drop” of newly created money, neither is forthcoming. Under the terms of its bailout agreement, the Greek government is obliged to cut spending and raise taxes. It has agreed to run a primary surplus on its budget equivalent to 0.5 per cent of G.D.P. in 2016, 1.75 per cent of G.D.P. in 2017, and 3.5 per cent of G.D.P. in 2018. Boosting the money supply isn’t an option, either—because&nbsp;Greece chose to remain in the eurozone, the monetary spigot is still controlled by the E.C.B. in Frankfurt.</p> <p>If the Greek government isn’t going to support the economy, what about the private sector? An optimistic reading is that once financial stability is restored, and the banks are functioning normally, consumers will start buying again and businesses will start investing in offices, plants, and equipment. Restoring credit flows will&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;help somewhat, but with so many people still out of work there seems to be little prospect of a consumer boom. And business investment usually trails other forms of spending, rather than leading them.</p> <p>What about exports, which have&nbsp;played a key role in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Ireland-2015-overview.pdf">Ireland’s recovery&nbsp;from its debt crisis</a>? Since Greece’s&nbsp;depression started, wages and prices have fallen steadily, which should have made its goods more competitive on world markets.&nbsp;But Ireland entered its economic slump with a much stronger industrial and export base than Greece’s. Throughout its lengthy recession, Ireland continued to receive quite a lot of foreign investment, particularly from multinational firms attracted by the country’s well-educated, English-speaking workforce and its lax corporate tax laws. Greece, by contrast, hasn’t attracted nearly as much investment. Its export sector still relies heavily on low-tech goods, such as petroleum products (the country has a number of large refineries), food and beverages, and textiles. And with many of its European trading partners also suffering economically, demand for these Greek products has been pretty weak.</p> <p>That leaves tourism, which is Greece’s largest industry. Can tourism save Greece? Alas, probably not. On the plus side, the recent fall in the value of the euro means that Greece is now a more affordable destination for people outside the eurozone: in 2015, according to its economy ministry, it will attract more than twenty-one million visitors. But a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/sa_gr_8_14.pdf">2014 report</a>&nbsp;from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College pointed out that although Greece’s tourism industry is large (according to various estimates, it accounts for between fifteen and twenty per cent of G.D.P.) it isn’t big enough to offset weakness elsewhere&nbsp;in the economy.</p> <p>Moreover, the tourism industry is now facing the unprecedented challenge of a refugee crisis. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than two hundred thousand refugees&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unhcr.gr/fileadmin/Greece/Extras/Arrivals/operational/Greece_Operational_Update___2.pdf">have arrived in Greece this year</a>, many of them landing on islands in the Aegean Sea favored by tourists, such as Lesbos and Kos. As the&nbsp;<em>Times</em>&nbsp;columnist Roger Cohen&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/opinion/roger-cohen-more-efficiency-less-humanity.html">pointed out</a>&nbsp;on Monday&nbsp;and Nicolas Niarchos&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-island-of-refugees">described here last week</a>, the Greeks have&nbsp;generally treated the refugees well, providing them with food and shelter. For a country that is already facing enormous difficulties, this is yet another one.</p> <p>It’s a pretty dismal picture all around, and it reflects&nbsp;what happens when&nbsp;austerity policies&nbsp;are imposed on&nbsp;a country with huge debts, a fixed exchange rate, no sovereignty over monetary policy, and a weak export sector. This is the vise Greece has been caught in since 2009. It’s still trapped.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>How long will the smile on the face of Alexis Tsipras last?&nbsp;On Monday night, Tsipras was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/21/alexis-tsipras-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-of-greece/">sworn in as the head of a new Greek government</a>&nbsp;that looks very similar to the previous one.

After the result of the election became clear, he said that it had given him a “clear mandate to carry on fighting inside and outside our country to uphold the pride of our people.” But he didn’t mention anything about pension cuts, privatization, or other unpopular reforms.</p> <p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=991061">research note</a>&nbsp;released on Monday, the Wall Street ratings agency Fitch said that the Greek government’s “ownership” of the reform program “is likely to remain less than whole-hearted, and its negotiating stance unpredictable.”&nbsp;That seems about right. At the same time that the new Syriza government&nbsp;sets about&nbsp;passing a series of laws designed to reduce the budget deficit and open up Greece’s economy to competition—for example, by&nbsp;deregulating the energy market, scrapping price controls for medicines, and selling state-owned ports and airports to private companies—it will be busy recapitalizing the country’s banks, which saw big withdrawals of capital during the spring and early summer. As in other countries that have been down this path, the sight of big banks receiving large infusions of public money while budget cuts are being introduced elsewhere is likely to prove toxic politically.</p> <p>Tsipras doesn’t have much choice, however. Since his government imposed emergency capital controls&nbsp;in late June, placing strict limits on how much cash Greeks can withdraw from banks, liquidity has been in short supply, and some parts of the economy have been reduced&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/business/international/trading-meat-for-tires-as-bartering-economy-grows-in-greece.html">to barter</a>. To restore confidence in the banking system, and to get credit flowing again, the banks’&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/05/us-eurozone-greece-banks-idUSKCN0QA1QX20150805">balance sheets will have to be reinforced</a>, and that is where a good portion of the bailout funds will be directed. As for the rest of the money, much of it will go toward interest payments on Greece’s existing mountain of debt—i.e., it will go straight back to the country’s creditors, who, at this stage, consist largely of other European Union countries, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>This won’t be popular, either. The key issue&nbsp;is whether introducing structural reforms, stabilizing the banking system, and, possibly, beginning negotiations to receive debt relief will be sufficient to restore lasting growth to the Greek economy, which has enormous stocks of unused resources. Which brings us back to Tsipras’s larger economic challenge.&nbsp;To be sure, the country has a number of serious problems that are crimping its long-term prospects, such as crony capitalism, corruption, and tax evasion. But the immediate task is to put an end to a depression that has seen Greece’s G.D.P. fall by a quarter, the unemployment rate reach twenty-six per cent (more than fifty per cent among the young), and the number of people experiencing severe deprivation—meaning that they can’t afford to buy basic items, such as food and shelter—rising&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33507802">to about twenty per cent.</a></p> <p>In the long term, Greece needs structural reforms, but in the short term it needs to get back to work. To bring that about,&nbsp;the country needs higher levels of demand throughout the economy. But where is that extra demand going to come from?</p> <p>Not from the government sector. While Greece is crying out for a Keynesian fiscal stimulus or a Friedmanite “helicopter drop” of newly created money, neither is forthcoming. Under the terms of its bailout agreement, the Greek government is obliged to cut spending and raise taxes. It has agreed to run a primary surplus on its budget equivalent to 0.5 per cent of G.D.P. in 2016, 1.75 per cent of G.D.P. in 2017, and 3.5 per cent of G.D.P. in 2018. Boosting the money supply isn’t an option, either—because&nbsp;Greece chose to remain in the eurozone, the monetary spigot is still controlled by the E.C.B. in Frankfurt.</p> <p>If the Greek government isn’t going to support the economy, what about the private sector? An optimistic reading is that once financial stability is restored, and the banks are functioning normally, consumers will start buying again and businesses will start investing in offices, plants, and equipment. Restoring credit flows will&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;help somewhat, but with so many people still out of work there seems to be little prospect of a consumer boom. And business investment usually trails other forms of spending, rather than leading them.</p> <p>What about exports, which have&nbsp;played a key role in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Ireland-2015-overview.pdf">Ireland’s recovery&nbsp;from its debt crisis</a>? Since Greece’s&nbsp;depression started, wages and prices have fallen steadily, which should have made its goods more competitive on world markets.&nbsp;But Ireland entered its economic slump with a much stronger industrial and export base than Greece’s. Throughout its lengthy recession, Ireland continued to receive quite a lot of foreign investment, particularly from multinational firms attracted by the country’s well-educated, English-speaking workforce and its lax corporate tax laws. Greece, by contrast, hasn’t attracted nearly as much investment. Its export sector still relies heavily on low-tech goods, such as petroleum products (the country has a number of large refineries), food and beverages, and textiles. And with many of its European trading partners also suffering economically, demand for these Greek products has been pretty weak.</p> <p>That leaves tourism, which is Greece’s largest industry. Can tourism save Greece? Alas, probably not. On the plus side, the recent fall in the value of the euro means that Greece is now a more affordable destination for people outside the eurozone: in 2015, according to its economy ministry, it will attract more than twenty-one million visitors. But a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/sa_gr_8_14.pdf">2014 report</a>&nbsp;from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College pointed out that although Greece’s tourism industry is large (according to various estimates, it accounts for between fifteen and twenty per cent of G.D.P.) it isn’t big enough to offset weakness elsewhere&nbsp;in the economy.</p> <p>Moreover, the tourism industry is now facing the unprecedented challenge of a refugee crisis. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than two hundred thousand refugees&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unhcr.gr/fileadmin/Greece/Extras/Arrivals/operational/Greece_Operational_Update___2.pdf">have arrived in Greece this year</a>, many of them landing on islands in the Aegean Sea favored by tourists, such as Lesbos and Kos. As the&nbsp;<em>Times</em>&nbsp;columnist Roger Cohen&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/opinion/roger-cohen-more-efficiency-less-humanity.html">pointed out</a>&nbsp;on Monday&nbsp;and Nicolas Niarchos&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-island-of-refugees">described here last week</a>, the Greeks have&nbsp;generally treated the refugees well, providing them with food and shelter. For a country that is already facing enormous difficulties, this is yet another one.</p> <p>It’s a pretty dismal picture all around, and it reflects&nbsp;what happens when&nbsp;austerity policies&nbsp;are imposed on&nbsp;a country with huge debts, a fixed exchange rate, no sovereignty over monetary policy, and a weak export sector. This is the vise Greece has been caught in since 2009. It’s still trapped.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

Late in 1944, she was having dinner at the Stork Club when the director Otto Preminger walked in. Preminger was just coming off the great success of “Laura,” the film he directed based on Caspary’s novel of the same name, which is included in “Women Crime Writers.” In both the book and the movie, a woman is shot dead in her Manhattan apartment; days later, the presumed victim, Laura, walks in the door quite obviously alive. The mix-up makes her a suspect in her own murder. The success of Preminger’s adaptation vaulted him out of intra-studio shouting matches into fame and industry clout (and an Oscar nomination). He could have behaved graciously toward the woman whose novel provided the characters, story, and premise that audiences and critics alike couldn’t resist.</p> <p>Instead, as Caspary put it in a memoir, “Preminger turned with a grin of triumph to inform me that the biggest hit of the year was the screenplay I’d criticized.” Preminger was a difficult man, known for screaming on sets and casting himself as a Nazi in his own movies. He was big, too. Caspary was shorter, older, framed by a cloud of frizzy hair. The “hysterical” shouting that followed Preminger’s remark brought waiters running and Caspary’s companions to their feet, as they “snatched off their jackets prepared to defend my honour.” A brawl was narrowly averted. This, Caspary reported, was a “fuss and fury that swelled my pride.”</p> <p>Caspary&nbsp;<em>did</em><em>&nbsp;</em>hate the script that Preminger had first shown her. She’d given up the right to shape her characters for the screen by way of what she called “one of the worst contracts ever signed.” “Laura,” when published, had been a hot enough property to attract the attentions of Marlene Dietrich. But Caspary had, by then, been kicking around the movie business for a long time. She used the generous screenplay payments to finance her novels. Conscious of what a struggle it could be, in the collaborative environment of the movie studios, to get a picture made, she made an impulsive decision to let the producers write their own script.</p> <p>When invited to read the first draft of the script, what bothered her most was Preminger’s ideas about the story’s dead-but-not-dead title character, Laura Hunt. He told Caspary, “In the book, Laura has no character. She’s nothing, a nonentity.” He added, “She has no sex. She has to keep a gigolo.” (He was referring to Laura’s fiancé, whom she supports financially but who is never identified as a prostitute.) Preminger had remedied this by all but stripping out Laura’s professional ambitions and practical-mindedness.</p> <p>Caspary was appalled. “I raged like a shrew,” she remembered. “I resented Preminger’s turning her into the Hollywood version of a cute career girl.” Here, she thought, was evidence that Preminger didn’t know a thing about women, their “maternal instinct,” their “satisfaction in consoling a troubled man.”</p> <p>Eventually, Caspary admitted that she found the final script wittier than the one she’d been shown. But she had been on to something: the Laura whom Gene Tierney played was more remarkable for her gorgeousness than for her other charms. It worked in the context of Preminger’s movie, but as an account of a career woman of the time, it lacks what you might call “moxie.”</p> <p>Caspary was invested in the character because she’d modeled Laura’s personality on her own. She was a “career girl”&nbsp;<em>avant la lettre</em> and never seems to have pictured or wished herself otherwise. Born to bourgeois Jewish parents in Chicago in 1899, she went out to work almost as soon as she turned eighteen and rarely stopped churning out copy from that day until she died. There was no college and no finishing school, no slow courtship of traditional critical respect. She had to make a living, so she wrote.</p> <p>Her first jobs had her writing the materials for scam correspondence courses on everything from ballet to salesmanship to screenplay writing. She did a little journalism, of the “RAT BITES SLEEPING CHILD!” sort, but credited a job at the Trianon ballroom in Chicago with opening her mind to experiences not her own. “I became both editor and staff of&nbsp;<em>Trianon Topics</em>,” she explained, “an eight-page tabloid-sized weekly devoted to clean dancing.” She worked the way most journalists once did: she hung around, talking to every sort of person who came through the place. And though she could not print scandals, she found that “through the gathering of inane and trivial news I was educated and profoundly changed.”</p> <p>Her politics, personal and otherwise, were all of the liberatory variety. She had lovers aplenty long before feminism’s second wave arrived. One was a former boss, from an advertising agency where she was a copywriter. She’d later move to New York, working at dance magazines, hanging around Greenwich Village, and moving in socialist and Communist circles (which would come to haunt her in the era of HUAC and black-listing).</p> <p>Caspary’s first novel, called “The White Girl,” tells the story of a black woman passing as white in Chicago. It was praised by a number of African-American newspapers, even as white papers mostly ignored the book. “There are many Solaria Coxes in America,” the&nbsp;<em>Chicago</em> <em>Defender</em><em>&nbsp;</em>wrote, “and Miss Vera Caspary, who happens to be a former Chicagoan, must have met some of them. She knows them far better than most white people get to know them.”</p> <p>The critical success of that book seemed to encourage Caspary in marrying her politics and her art: when she turned to writing plays, she set one of them in a women’s residence and had one of the characters seek out an abortion. She wrote another that saw a housewife, in extremis, sell herself to bill collectors. To a producer who felt that the story was dirty, because the price set on the woman’s virtue was so low, Caspary retorted, “Do you think a whore who gets fifty dollars is morally superior to one who gets five?”</p> <p>Caspary’s memoir, “The Secrets of Grown-Ups,” published in 1979 and lamentably out of print, is full of such anecdotes. She was not, as a person, free from self-doubt. “I have a poor memory for distress,” she wrote, “but can recall discontent and raging fevers of impatience.” She seems to have been, in spite of a few successful books and screenplays, forever running out of money.</p> <p>But, at least on the page, Caspary had almost supernatural powers of bemusement; she turned her sorrows into triumphs. She liked to joke about her attractiveness to “macaroni salesmen.” Her husband, whom she met when she was forty, was a movie producer, but she earned more than he did, and he resented it. She tried to ignore his resentment, and corrected people at parties who called her Mrs. Goldsmith.</p> <p>For all that, something seems to have gotten lost when the author tried to channel her own spirit into Laura. The fictional character is less direct and less charismatic than her creator. The genius of the novel, the thing that hooked Preminger and had studio executives begging Caspary, for the rest of her life, to write another like it, was another character: Waldo Lydecker, Laura’s sometime mentor and friend.</p> <p>Lydecker is the sort of man who refers casually to “Roberto, my Filipino manservant.” A newspaper columnist by trade, he is corpulent and arrogant. He is not afraid to tell his readers that he hates mystery stories, finds them flat and unappealing. “I offer the narrative,” he declares, “not so much as a detective yarn as a love story.” That, right there, is the siren song of the unreliable narrator, and also of a type: the predatory, cosmopolitan, maybe gay (but maybe not) villain.</p> <p>In the film, Lydecker is played by Clifton Webb, who was not obese, but otherwise fit the bill nicely. (Webb was also fairly openly gay, at least to those in the know in Hollywood.) Preminger claimed that the character was truly authored not by Caspary but by the last screenwriter on the project, Samuel Hoffenstein, who had the actor in mind: “Hoffenstein practically created the character of Waldo Lydecker for Clifton Webb,” he said.</p> <p>Actually, the recipe was not so simple. It is generally assumed that Lydecker was based on Alexander Woollcott, the theatre critic who wrote “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alexander-woollcott">Shouts and Murmurs</a>” for <em>The New Yorker</em> and started the Algonquin Round Table. Woollcott was quite large and gay and could have been described as pretentious (he allegedly&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.longreads.com/2014/04/30/the-odd-couple-alexander-woollcott-and-harpo-our-longreads-member-pick/">described himself as such</a>&nbsp;on one occasion). Caspary undoubtedly knew of him, as she knew other members of his set. Her name sometimes appeared in Franklin Pierce Adams’s gossip columns; she wrote some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vera-caspary">light items for this magazine</a>.</p> <p>But there is another source for the character. The writing of “Laura” was a kind of accident, done for money. Caspary did not like murder mysteries herself, and she saw in them a structural flaw. “The murderer, the most interesting character,” she wrote, “has always to be on the periphery of action lest he give away the secret that can be revealed only in the final pages.” If she was going to write one, she decided she needed to do it differently.</p> <p>A friend suggested she read Wilkie Collins’s “The Woman in White” and try out his manner of using the voices of several characters to weave the story. It worked, not least because she found inspiration for Lydecker’s type in Collins’s villainous, obese Count Fosco. “Crime is in this country what crime is in other countries—a good friend to a man and to those about him, as often as it is his enemy,” Fosco declares in that book.</p> <p>Lydecker’s genealogy is of more than academic interest. Caspary and Preminger can be seen to occupy the roles of the characters she created. There she was, a capable woman of few artistic pretensions, trying to get ahead in the world.

Late in 1944, she was having dinner at the Stork Club when the director Otto Preminger walked in. Preminger was just coming off the great success of “Laura,” the film he directed based on Caspary’s novel of the same name, which is included in “Women Crime Writers.” In both the book and the movie, a woman is shot dead in her Manhattan apartment; days later, the presumed victim, Laura, walks in the door quite obviously alive. The mix-up makes her a suspect in her own murder. The success of Preminger’s adaptation vaulted him out of intra-studio shouting matches into fame and industry clout (and an Oscar nomination). He could have behaved graciously toward the woman whose novel provided the characters, story, and premise that audiences and critics alike couldn’t resist.</p> <p>Instead, as Caspary put it in a memoir, “Preminger turned with a grin of triumph to inform me that the biggest hit of the year was the screenplay I’d criticized.” Preminger was a difficult man, known for screaming on sets and casting himself as a Nazi in his own movies. He was big, too. Caspary was shorter, older, framed by a cloud of frizzy hair. The “hysterical” shouting that followed Preminger’s remark brought waiters running and Caspary’s companions to their feet, as they “snatched off their jackets prepared to defend my honour.” A brawl was narrowly averted. This, Caspary reported, was a “fuss and fury that swelled my pride.”</p> <p>Caspary&nbsp;<em>did</em><em>&nbsp;</em>hate the script that Preminger had first shown her. She’d given up the right to shape her characters for the screen by way of what she called “one of the worst contracts ever signed.” “Laura,” when published, had been a hot enough property to attract the attentions of Marlene Dietrich. But Caspary had, by then, been kicking around the movie business for a long time. She used the generous screenplay payments to finance her novels. Conscious of what a struggle it could be, in the collaborative environment of the movie studios, to get a picture made, she made an impulsive decision to let the producers write their own script.</p> <p>When invited to read the first draft of the script, what bothered her most was Preminger’s ideas about the story’s dead-but-not-dead title character, Laura Hunt. He told Caspary, “In the book, Laura has no character. She’s nothing, a nonentity.” He added, “She has no sex. She has to keep a gigolo.” (He was referring to Laura’s fiancé, whom she supports financially but who is never identified as a prostitute.) Preminger had remedied this by all but stripping out Laura’s professional ambitions and practical-mindedness.</p> <p>Caspary was appalled. “I raged like a shrew,” she remembered. “I resented Preminger’s turning her into the Hollywood version of a cute career girl.” Here, she thought, was evidence that Preminger didn’t know a thing about women, their “maternal instinct,” their “satisfaction in consoling a troubled man.”</p> <p>Eventually, Caspary admitted that she found the final script wittier than the one she’d been shown. But she had been on to something: the Laura whom Gene Tierney played was more remarkable for her gorgeousness than for her other charms. It worked in the context of Preminger’s movie, but as an account of a career woman of the time, it lacks what you might call “moxie.”</p> <p>Caspary was invested in the character because she’d modeled Laura’s personality on her own. She was a “career girl”&nbsp;<em>avant la lettre</em> and never seems to have pictured or wished herself otherwise. Born to bourgeois Jewish parents in Chicago in 1899, she went out to work almost as soon as she turned eighteen and rarely stopped churning out copy from that day until she died. There was no college and no finishing school, no slow courtship of traditional critical respect. She had to make a living, so she wrote.</p> <p>Her first jobs had her writing the materials for scam correspondence courses on everything from ballet to salesmanship to screenplay writing. She did a little journalism, of the “RAT BITES SLEEPING CHILD!” sort, but credited a job at the Trianon ballroom in Chicago with opening her mind to experiences not her own. “I became both editor and staff of&nbsp;<em>Trianon Topics</em>,” she explained, “an eight-page tabloid-sized weekly devoted to clean dancing.” She worked the way most journalists once did: she hung around, talking to every sort of person who came through the place. And though she could not print scandals, she found that “through the gathering of inane and trivial news I was educated and profoundly changed.”</p> <p>Her politics, personal and otherwise, were all of the liberatory variety. She had lovers aplenty long before feminism’s second wave arrived. One was a former boss, from an advertising agency where she was a copywriter. She’d later move to New York, working at dance magazines, hanging around Greenwich Village, and moving in socialist and Communist circles (which would come to haunt her in the era of HUAC and black-listing).</p> <p>Caspary’s first novel, called “The White Girl,” tells the story of a black woman passing as white in Chicago. It was praised by a number of African-American newspapers, even as white papers mostly ignored the book. “There are many Solaria Coxes in America,” the&nbsp;<em>Chicago</em> <em>Defender</em><em>&nbsp;</em>wrote, “and Miss Vera Caspary, who happens to be a former Chicagoan, must have met some of them. She knows them far better than most white people get to know them.”</p> <p>The critical success of that book seemed to encourage Caspary in marrying her politics and her art: when she turned to writing plays, she set one of them in a women’s residence and had one of the characters seek out an abortion. She wrote another that saw a housewife, in extremis, sell herself to bill collectors. To a producer who felt that the story was dirty, because the price set on the woman’s virtue was so low, Caspary retorted, “Do you think a whore who gets fifty dollars is morally superior to one who gets five?”</p> <p>Caspary’s memoir, “The Secrets of Grown-Ups,” published in 1979 and lamentably out of print, is full of such anecdotes. She was not, as a person, free from self-doubt. “I have a poor memory for distress,” she wrote, “but can recall discontent and raging fevers of impatience.” She seems to have been, in spite of a few successful books and screenplays, forever running out of money.</p> <p>But, at least on the page, Caspary had almost supernatural powers of bemusement; she turned her sorrows into triumphs. She liked to joke about her attractiveness to “macaroni salesmen.” Her husband, whom she met when she was forty, was a movie producer, but she earned more than he did, and he resented it. She tried to ignore his resentment, and corrected people at parties who called her Mrs. Goldsmith.</p> <p>For all that, something seems to have gotten lost when the author tried to channel her own spirit into Laura. The fictional character is less direct and less charismatic than her creator. The genius of the novel, the thing that hooked Preminger and had studio executives begging Caspary, for the rest of her life, to write another like it, was another character: Waldo Lydecker, Laura’s sometime mentor and friend.</p> <p>Lydecker is the sort of man who refers casually to “Roberto, my Filipino manservant.” A newspaper columnist by trade, he is corpulent and arrogant. He is not afraid to tell his readers that he hates mystery stories, finds them flat and unappealing. “I offer the narrative,” he declares, “not so much as a detective yarn as a love story.” That, right there, is the siren song of the unreliable narrator, and also of a type: the predatory, cosmopolitan, maybe gay (but maybe not) villain.</p> <p>In the film, Lydecker is played by Clifton Webb, who was not obese, but otherwise fit the bill nicely. (Webb was also fairly openly gay, at least to those in the know in Hollywood.) Preminger claimed that the character was truly authored not by Caspary but by the last screenwriter on the project, Samuel Hoffenstein, who had the actor in mind: “Hoffenstein practically created the character of Waldo Lydecker for Clifton Webb,” he said.</p> <p>Actually, the recipe was not so simple. It is generally assumed that Lydecker was based on Alexander Woollcott, the theatre critic who wrote “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alexander-woollcott">Shouts and Murmurs</a>” for <em>The New Yorker</em> and started the Algonquin Round Table. Woollcott was quite large and gay and could have been described as pretentious (he allegedly&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.longreads.com/2014/04/30/the-odd-couple-alexander-woollcott-and-harpo-our-longreads-member-pick/">described himself as such</a>&nbsp;on one occasion). Caspary undoubtedly knew of him, as she knew other members of his set. Her name sometimes appeared in Franklin Pierce Adams’s gossip columns; she wrote some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vera-caspary">light items for this magazine</a>.</p> <p>But there is another source for the character. The writing of “Laura” was a kind of accident, done for money. Caspary did not like murder mysteries herself, and she saw in them a structural flaw. “The murderer, the most interesting character,” she wrote, “has always to be on the periphery of action lest he give away the secret that can be revealed only in the final pages.” If she was going to write one, she decided she needed to do it differently.</p> <p>A friend suggested she read Wilkie Collins’s “The Woman in White” and try out his manner of using the voices of several characters to weave the story. It worked, not least because she found inspiration for Lydecker’s type in Collins’s villainous, obese Count Fosco. “Crime is in this country what crime is in other countries—a good friend to a man and to those about him, as often as it is his enemy,” Fosco declares in that book.</p> <p>Lydecker’s genealogy is of more than academic interest. Caspary and Preminger can be seen to occupy the roles of the characters she created. There she was, a capable woman of few artistic pretensions, trying to get ahead in the world. There he was, physically imposing and convinced of his own gifts, wanting to possess her story in order to claim a certain amount of its authorship for himself. And, in a way, unlike Lydecker, Preminger succeeded: far more people know his film now than have read her novel. Perhaps that is the one way in which Vera Caspary can be called a victim.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

It also, somewhat remarkably, works very well on television. But football on television is an entity unto itself: the comprehensive illusion of football, far from the full picture. As a result, there may be no activity that draws closer public scrutiny that the public knows less about.</p> <p>Having all but lived with <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/how-to-save-football">a group of N.F.L. coaches</a> from 2011 to 2012 in an attempt to better understand the professional game, I am often asked what I can see in the flow of events when I watch a game on TV that I couldn’t see before. The answer is far less than you might imagine, and for reasons that speak to the nature of the sport and its relationship with TV.</p> <p>An activity ideally suited to the medium, football’s popularity flourished at a time, the nineteen-sixties, when television, too, was coming of age. In the next decade, ABC’s “Monday Night Football” became appointment viewing, in large part because the three-men-in-a-booth broadcast team of Howard Cosell, “Dandy” Don Meredith, and Frank Gifford narrated not so much sport as drama. What usually drives drama is character development, accumulating humanistic detail. But the sensibility of football is self-effacing, with players taught to conform by deferring to the group. Emphasizing that huddled temperament, the N.F.L. permits scant press access to players and coaches. And average careers in the Not-For-Long N.F.L. are brief, less than four years. All this has always made it challenging for fans to feel close to the participants.</p> <p>Bill Polian, the former general manager&nbsp;of the Indianapolis Colts who now is an analyst for ESPN, says that Cosell, Meredith, and Gifford turned football into “a spectacle and a television show rather than an athletic event.” While baseball broadcasters partner with viewers, who want to imagine the slow unfolding of something they know intimately well, football broadcasters interpret everything, so viewers needn’t think—only react. “TV is perfect for this incoherent game,” the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns says. “It’s this perverse American Noh drama they’ve convinced us we can make sense of. The game on TV is sleight of hand.” Burns says that even though he has no idea what’s going on, he’s a football “addict,” who watches games while texting missives to his best friend like “Did you see that?” and “What happened?” Today the journalists who get the most access from N.F.L. teams are the broadcasters, who watch practices and have extended conferences with coaches and significant players. And why not? They’re putting on a show together.</p> <p>Another source of confusion is that football annually reimagines itself with rule changes. N.F.L. teams meet with league officials for off-season rules briefings, yet rare is the player—or coach, even—who knows them all. Pity Eli Manning, the quarterback of the New York Giants, who, in a recent fourth quarter, became addled by the laws of the game clock and inadvertently left the Dallas Cowboys time for a game-winning drive. Pity the fan confronting a world where “illegal procedure” is no longer a specific infraction, but a category of infractions that includes many forms of misdemeanor.</p> <p>Potentially even more confounding for the Sunday viewer is the sport’s commitment to secret stratagems. Everything that takes place during games has been meticulously plotted and rehearsed at teams’ bunkered facilities. The closed society speaks a private language; football jargon changes from team to team. Much of a football player’s day takes place in a classroom, where he learns the playbook—a volume as thick as a John le Carré novel, and just as preoccupied with deception. The eventual “game plan” is made of opponent-appropriate selections from the playbook that are distributed on a “call sheet,” the list of formations and plays that offensive and defensive coordinators communicate by radio to players before the snap. (If you watch football, you’ve seen the sheets: they look like Mondrian paintings and tend to be held close to the face by play callers to prevent opposition lip-reading.) Thus games unfold according to scripts that nobody but team personnel ever sees. In contrast to baseball, which thrived because it was transparent and familiar, football is all about distance.</p> <p>Televised football’s triumph was to make something fundamentally remote seem close at hand. Thinking about how it succeeded brings Raymond Chandler to mind. When Howard Hawks began preparing to film Chandler’s greatest crime novel, “The Big Sleep,” the director found himself unable to follow the novel’s succession of plot points. So, famously, Hawks wired Chandler to ask who killed the chauffeur. Chandler said he had no idea. The foremost thrill of Chandler is how vivid it feels—the mood, atmosphere, and tone. Readers enter an overcast world where the pleasure of the thoughts and sentences is so intensely gratifying that nobody much cares about the granular details.</p> <p>So often in the arts, the catalyst for innovation is limitation, and that was certainly the way with football. Football works so well on television—and now, also, on cell phones and laptops—because the gridiron on which the game is played conforms so readily to a screen. (This is also true for basketball courts and hockey rinks, but those spaces are smaller and more cluttered with players, and the games played on those surfaces don’t stop, clear, and reset after every play, as football does.) The dimensions of the screen organize elements that might otherwise feel chaotic. That each play involves too many men to follow becomes less important when a viewer is tasked simply with tracking the ball. Telescoping the real-time game with such clarity is impossible, which is why coaches, when asked about specific plays immediately after games, often sound like Chandler confessing to Hawks, as they explain that they won’t have any idea what just happened until they get a look at the game film.</p> <p>“Before modern TV, it must have felt more abstractly gladiatorial,” Richard Linklater, the filmmaker, who was himself a Texas high school quarterback, says. We were discussing the way that these days, on television, you can impart personalities to the players and coaches on the screen. The N.F.L. has wired participants for sound and improved its broadcasts’ camera angles and photograph definition. Camera operators pan the field and sidelines for raw reactions. The emotion fans tend to feel most keenly is outrage, and, following along, producers have lately specialized in conveying assorted shades of indignation. We think of Giants coach Tom Coughlin as a man perpetually aggrieved and consider Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan a puerile teenager—after all, that’s how they behave in our homes. Of course, both men are far more complex. “Once you can see their eyes, everything changes, and you think you know them,” Linklater says. “TV does that—that powerful, possessory bond with the audience. The public might fawn over actors they know from movies, but if they know you from television, they act like they’re a relative. They really think they have access, and they almost consume them.”</p> <p>Part of football’s appeal is the violence, which gives it the feeling of a real-life action movie. But the violence has always been risky for TV, as well as for the players. Long before there was any public controversy concerning <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/10/19/offensive-play">the long-term effects of football-related blows to the head</a>, TV sought to make the game more palatable by magnifying its balletic beauty and deëmphasizing the brute concussive aggression of the hitting. One of the game’s most notorious collisions took place on “Monday Night Football” in 1985, when Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor sacked Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann. The reverse camera angle revealed Theismann suffering a grotesque compound leg fracture. That was too much reality for family television. In the decades since then, much to the dismay of defensive coaches, the most revealing football rules changes have put restraints on contact and otherwise eased the task of completing passes. Part of this is that America loves touchdowns, and another piece of it is that passing looks prettier on TV. But concerning ourselves with the graceful choreographies of receivers and defensive backs also relieved us of the unsettling responsibility for witnessing what’s going down off-camera.</p> <p>To see the full truth of a football game, you’d have to enter an N.F.L. facility on Monday morning and watch the game film along with the coaches. Coaching film has no audio and is shot from end zone and sideline angles at sufficient depth that coaches can see what all twenty-two players are doing. Football involves large, fast men navigating a limited patch of land over and over again, with a map designed for each one of these brief excursions. The coaches have made the maps, and they spend their film sessions scrutinizing every player’s every movement, assessing what worked, what didn’t, and why. This is where I saw how many small elements of design go into big plays. The best I ever encountered at analyzing game tape was Mike Pettine, who is now the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. It’s testament to the game’s difficulty that last Monday, Pettine, who prizes discipline and intelligence in football players, suffered through game film featuring twelve Browns penalties and five Browns turnovers in the team’s loss to the Jets.</p> <p>After I learned how to listen to them, I always found those Monday coaching seminars completely absorbing: they are the inner tale of the battle. “Coaching tape, it’s a different world,” Bill Polian says. “Watching TV as a spectator, you’re caught up in the weekly narrative, whether you have a bet on the game, whether you’re playing Fantasy. Coaching tape is the reality of the game.” He explains that the two experiences are the difference between observing someone fly an airplane from a comfortable seat, and knowing what the pilots know—the flight plan, what’s on the gauges, the effect of air and atmosphere, the technical details of an intricate operation.</p> <p>To me, it’s the difference between Tom Brady and Ernie Adams. Brady, the quarterback of the New England Patriots, is a stunningly effective exponent of the game’s most important position, and he possesses the good looks of a television actor. Otherwise, though, Brady seems fairly bland. Adams is the New England Patriots’ in-house master of strategies, a mysterious figure obscured by sunglasses and low cap brims whose insights into the game are legendary, though nobody except his boss, the Patriots’ hooded head coach, Bill Belichick, can say what they are. You can easily imagine Adams as a literary character; less so in pixels. Yet, in a sense, TV has increased Adams’ value. As TV made the games so public and so popular, the situation only emphasized what was required to win them: privacy.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Football is a blurry-fast, rough game in which twenty-two players, obscured by armor and masks, zoom around before slamming together in shapeless protoplasmic scrums.

One of the game’s most notorious collisions took place on “Monday Night Football” in 1985, when Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor sacked Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann. The reverse camera angle revealed Theismann suffering a grotesque compound leg fracture. That was too much reality for family television. In the decades since then, much to the dismay of defensive coaches, the most revealing football rules changes have put restraints on contact and otherwise eased the task of completing passes. Part of this is that America loves touchdowns, and another piece of it is that passing looks prettier on TV. But concerning ourselves with the graceful choreographies of receivers and defensive backs also relieved us of the unsettling responsibility for witnessing what’s going down off-camera.</p> <p>To see the full truth of a football game, you’d have to enter an N.F.L. facility on Monday morning and watch the game film along with the coaches. Coaching film has no audio and is shot from end zone and sideline angles at sufficient depth that coaches can see what all twenty-two players are doing. Football involves large, fast men navigating a limited patch of land over and over again, with a map designed for each one of these brief excursions. The coaches have made the maps, and they spend their film sessions scrutinizing every player’s every movement, assessing what worked, what didn’t, and why. This is where I saw how many small elements of design go into big plays. The best I ever encountered at analyzing game tape was Mike Pettine, who is now the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. It’s testament to the game’s difficulty that last Monday, Pettine, who prizes discipline and intelligence in football players, suffered through game film featuring twelve Browns penalties and five Browns turnovers in the team’s loss to the Jets.</p> <p>After I learned how to listen to them, I always found those Monday coaching seminars completely absorbing: they are the inner tale of the battle. “Coaching tape, it’s a different world,” Bill Polian says. “Watching TV as a spectator, you’re caught up in the weekly narrative, whether you have a bet on the game, whether you’re playing Fantasy. Coaching tape is the reality of the game.” He explains that the two experiences are the difference between observing someone fly an airplane from a comfortable seat, and knowing what the pilots know—the flight plan, what’s on the gauges, the effect of air and atmosphere, the technical details of an intricate operation.</p> <p>To me, it’s the difference between Tom Brady and Ernie Adams. Brady, the quarterback of the New England Patriots, is a stunningly effective exponent of the game’s most important position, and he possesses the good looks of a television actor. Otherwise, though, Brady seems fairly bland. Adams is the New England Patriots’ in-house master of strategies, a mysterious figure obscured by sunglasses and low cap brims whose insights into the game are legendary, though nobody except his boss, the Patriots’ hooded head coach, Bill Belichick, can say what they are. You can easily imagine Adams as a literary character; less so in pixels. Yet, in a sense, TV has increased Adams’ value. As TV made the games so public and so popular, the situation only emphasized what was required to win them: privacy.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

Ewing</dc:creator>			<pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 17:00:32 +0000</pubDate>						<description><!\[CDATA\[<p>On a recent Friday, near twilight in the Bronzeville community of the South Side of Chicago, a group of protesters and their supporters marched from the national headquarters of the Rainbow <small>PUSH</small> Coalition to President Obama’s house. It’s not a long walk, but this crowd moved slowly. Parents pushed young children in strollers, and held the older ones by their hands. College students moved with a vigor that belied the solemnity of the march, which was organized to support the group of parents and community members that has been engaged in a hunger strike to re-open a local high school. Elders cautiously stepped down from the curb to uneven asphalt. Twice, a bus whizzed by on its evening route, finding space to pass even as the marchers took up a lane of traffic. Both times, the drivers honked and raised gloved fists, nodding in support. By the time the procession arrived at the corner across from the President’s home, the sun had fallen. A circle of protesters formed across from a line of cement barriers, watchful guards, an oversized black S.U.V., and a thick wall of shrubbery. As a police van passed, an old song rose from the circle: “We shall not, we shall not be moved / Just like a tree that’s planted by the water / We shall not be moved.”</p> <p>The hunger strike was started in response to the closing, at the end of the last school year, of Walter H. Dyett High School. The closure was the final act in a four-year phase-out: the school was no longer allowed to enroll new students, teachers slowly trickled away, and the students who remained were encouraged to transfer elsewhere. In the 2014-2015 school year, only thirteen students remained in Dyett’s final graduating class. The school was shuttered for being what the district called “chronically underperforming.”</p> <p>In response to the planned closure, a group of local community members, educators, and organizations calling itself the Coalition to Revitalize Walter H. Dyett School submitted a plan to re-open Dyett with a focus on “global leadership and green technology.” The Chicago Public Schools system agreed to review the proposal, along with two others, but ultimately cancelled the hearing. In August, 2015, members of the coalition announced the hunger strike. In early September, eighteen days into the strike, <a href="http://cps.edu/News/Press_releases/Pages/PR1_09_03_2015.aspx">C.P.S. announced</a> plans to re-open Dyett as an arts-focussed school. According to the strikers, they were not involved in the development of that new plan and they were barred from entering the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/04/chicago-protesters-hunger-strike-school-future-divides-city">press conference</a> at which it was announced. On Saturday, the strike’s thirty-fourth day, the <a href="https://twitter.com/TeachForJustice/status/645260261960499204">protesters announced its end</a>.</p> <p>Many Chicagoans have rallied behind the coalition, but others, on the school board and in the media, have questioned whether a new Dyett will be able to enroll enough students to be a vibrant and sustainable school. The population in the surrounding community has fallen in recent years, and that decline has become a justification for school closures. “Where are they going to get their children from? Because right now there are not that many kids in the neighborhood. That would be the only question I’d have,” Dr. Mahalia Hines, a Board of Education member, said at an August meeting. This argument—that schools on the city’s predominately African-American South and West Sides should be closed because too many people have moved away from these areas—was also used during the saga of Chicago’s 2013 school closings, in which forty-nine public schools were closed in one fell swoop.</p> <p>The former superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett explained the closures by citing what she termed a “utilization crisis.” “For too long, children in certain parts of our city have been cheated out of the resources they need to succeed in the classroom because they are trapped in underutilized schools,” she said at the time. “The utilization crisis threatens our ability to provide every child in every school with access to a well-rounded, high-quality education that they deserve.” Byrd-Bennett’s argument that the schools should close because they were enrolled below their capacity was intended to counter another argument that was persistently bubbling up across the city—that the school-closing process was racist, and the schools were being closed because they served black students and, in many cases, employed black teachers. “What I cannot understand, and will not accept is that the proposals I am offering are racist,” Byrd-Bennett told members of the school board, local media, and assembled community members at a 2013 board meeting. “The greatest population losses in our city over the past decade have taken place in the South and the West sides. Underutilized schools in these areas are the result of demographic changes and not race.”</p> <p>But this picture fails to account for two of Chicago’s least-favorite reasons for national notoriety: the city’s history of segregation and its public-housing system. Perhaps the demographic changes that drove enrollment numbers down at schools like Dyett—indeed, the very “utilization crisis” itself—did not arise by happenstance but through the machinations of where and how black people in Chicago have been allowed to live in the course of the last hundred years. (Jelani Cobb recently wrote about <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/class-notes-annals-of-education-jelani-cobb">school reform, closures, and racism</a> in the magazine.)</p> <p>As thousands of African-Americans moved from the agricultural south to the industrial north during the Great Migration, many of them came to call Chicago home. But they were met with violence and restrictions that limited their housing options. Between 1917 and 1921 in Chicago, fifty-eight bombs struck the homes of black residents, bankers who loaned them mortgages, and real-estate agents who sold them property—a rate of one bombing every twenty days in a period of under four years. The home of Jesse Binga, the founder of the city’s first black-owned bank, was bombed six times, and no culprit was ever arrested even after police guards were assigned to watch the house and Binga offered a thousand-dollar reward.</p> <p>In 1941, the newly formed Chicago Housing Authority opened the Ida B. Wells Homes on the corner of Pershing and State Park Way (now King Drive). While the city already had four public-housing projects built before the Second World War, the Wells project (named after the writer and anti-lynching crusader who had lived only a few blocks away) was the first intended for Chicago’s black residents. Many of the first residents of Wells were thrilled to move there, welcoming the safe and well-maintained living conditions. In J. S. Fuerst’s “When Public Housing Was Paradise,” a collection of oral histories from Chicago Housing Authority residents and administrators, one person who moved in during that first year called Wells “some of the best housing you could have. We had plenty of heat, and I don’t remember any roaches or rats.” Another recalls being impressed, as a child, by “the new shiny stoves and refrigerators, and then a living room and a kitchen. It was nice and spacious, clean and well-lit, and it was home!”</p> <p>And safe, affordable housing was desperately needed. Violence, redlining, and restrictive covenants—private agreements between property owners and real-estate agents that homes not be sold to or occupied by black residents—kept black Chicagoans from venturing too far across the city in search of housing in the private market. Restrictive covenants were called “a marvelous delicately-woven chain armour … [excluding] any member of a race not Caucasian” by one member of the Chicago Real Estate Board, which even provided templates and model contracts that real-estate agents could use to develop their own exclusionary contracts.</p> <p>Through formal and informal means, black Chicagoans were literally kept in their place. By 1940, Bronzeville’s population had reached more than a hundred and fifty thousand, squeezed into an area of about three square miles—a density twice that of the city average. Many were crammed together in “kitchenettes,” tiny apartments carved out of units initially intended to hold only a few families and refashioned into small spaces with shared hallway bathrooms. Richard Wright described Bronzeville’s kitchenettes in his 1941 book “12 Million Black Voices”:</p> <blockquote word_count="43" data-wc="43"> <p>While Chicago is known today as one of America’s most segregated cities, in the early days of public housing there was a possibility that the C.H.A. would serve as an engine for creating integrated communities. <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-01-19/news/9303163647_1_public-housing-chicago-housing-authority-miss-wood">Elizabeth Wood</a>, the agency’s first director, was in favor of maintaining diverse residences and implemented a quota system in the hopes of bringing black and white families together in one area. And <em>families</em> were what the C.H.A. wanted; Wood argued that children were the most important beneficiaries of public housing.</p> <p>One of these goals was met, and one was not. Chicago’s white residents made it clear that they were not as enthused about the prospect of integration as Wood was. In 1947, mobs, infuriated that eight black families had moved into the C.H.A.’s Fernwood Homes, initiated violence that lasted for four nights and required more than a thousand police officers to quell. In 1953, a light-skinned African-American woman named Betty Howard was assigned housing in the all-white Trumbull Park Homes. When her family moved in, and neighbors recognized them as black, white mobs set off explosives and broke windows at their home until the family required police escorts to leave the house. Political leaders followed suit. When C.H.A. officials appeared before the city council with proposals for new housing construction, white aldermen routinely slashed at the lists of prospective locations until those projects slated for black communities were all that remained. What resulted was the construction of five more high-density housing projects, bringing the total in Bronzeville to eight thousand two hundred and thirty-three&nbsp;units, including the original Ida B. Wells and an extension added on in 1955.</p> <p>As for the goal of providing homes to children, Bronzeville’s public housing did that and then some. While architects and urban planners debated whether the towering high-rise structure that became such an iconic feature of C.H.A. housing was actually beneficial for residents or not, policymakers missed something else altogether. D. Bradford Hunt, the author of “Blueprint for Disaster: The Unraveling of Chicago Public Housing,” argues, “The urgent question should have been this: How many children can successfully live in a high-rise building?”</p> <p>In 1970, the families who lived in the Robert Taylor Homes, also in Bronzeville, averaged six people each—a total of six thousand two hundred and fifty&nbsp;adults and twenty thousand four hundred and forty&nbsp;children. Children outnumbered adults by more than three to one. In most other parts of the city, that ratio was inverted. One resident remembered her frustration with the crowding of children, telling the sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh about her memory of waiting in blocks-long lines for the merry-go-round on the playground, holding an ice-cream cone that would melt well before she could get on the ride.</p> <p>In his book, Hunt argues that the comparatively few adults available to interact with each child helped create the conditions for “social disorder,” including gang and drug activity. The city shifted its public-housing philosophy along similar logic. Ida B. Wells, the Robert Taylor Homes, and other Bronzeville high-rise projects have all been torn down as part of the C.H.A.’s “Plan for Transformation,” which Mayor Richard M. Daley launched in 1999. The C.H.A. touted its plan as a socially symbolic effort, one that went beyond physical changes to the city’s housing stock, writing that it “aims to build and strengthen communities by integrating public housing and its leaseholders into the larger social, economic and physical fabric of Chicago…. Where there were once isolated superblocks, the street grid is being recreated to seamlessly integrate the new developments into the surrounding neighborhoods.”</p> <p>The agency declared that residents would have the right to return to the newly constructed mixed-income housing that would replace the high-rises. It offered vouchers to find affordable housing in the city’s private market in the meantime—but not necessarily a right to return to their former community. In 2005, Venkatesh and Isil Celimli wrote that seventy-five per cent of C.H.A. residents surveyed stated a preference for returning to their old neighborhoods, but that <a href="http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/chicago.html">less than twenty per cent</a> would be able to do so. “I didn’t ask for none of this. But C.H.A. promised me,” one C.H.A. resident told the Chicago <em>Tribune</em>, in 2013. “They said there would be brand-new units and a brand-new complex. They say they want a mixed-income community…. Like thousands of others, C.H.A. told me I have a right to return. But to where?” Those families that remain in the C.H.A. system are subject to a variety of eligibility standards in order to stay, such as having to work thirty hours per week, requirements that they have adequate childcare and good credit ratings, and being subject to drug screening and background checks.</p> <p>It should come as no surprise, then, that the community where children once waited for hours just to use playground equipment and where the requirements have become prohibitive for the thousands of residents who once lived in public housing has now lost many of the young people who might otherwise fill its classrooms. According to population reports from the University of Chicago’s Chapin Hall Center for Children, from 1990 to 1995, Bronzeville lost only two hundred and seventy two children. In the next five years, the community lost more than six thousand. In the five-year period after that, between 2000 and 2005, Bronzeville lost more than seven thousand six&nbsp;hundred children. Between 2005 and 2010, nearly another two thousand seven&nbsp;hundred moved away.</p> <p>A century ago, migrants from the South came to Bronzeville in search of the freedom that had remained so elusive even after the end of slavery. Undoubtedly, though they came with the hope for economic prosperity, they were also looking for that portion of the American dream that has always had a special salience for black people: a quality education. What they found in the nineteen-twenties was physical, psychic, and structural violence that pinned them into place. What their descendants found in the two thousands was displacement, first from their homes, then from their schools. When black Chicagoans of today sing “We shall not be moved,” it’s both a promise and a prayer.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>On a recent Friday, near twilight in the Bronzeville community of the South Side of Chicago, a group of protesters and their supporters marched from the national headquarters of the Rainbow <small>PUSH</small> Coalition to President Obama’s house.

In 2005, Venkatesh and Isil Celimli wrote that seventy-five per cent of C.H.A. residents surveyed stated a preference for returning to their old neighborhoods, but that <a href="http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/chicago.html">less than twenty per cent</a> would be able to do so. “I didn’t ask for none of this. But C.H.A. promised me,” one C.H.A. resident told the Chicago <em>Tribune</em>, in 2013. “They said there would be brand-new units and a brand-new complex. They say they want a mixed-income community…. Like thousands of others, C.H.A. told me I have a right to return. But to where?” Those families that remain in the C.H.A. system are subject to a variety of eligibility standards in order to stay, such as having to work thirty hours per week, requirements that they have adequate childcare and good credit ratings, and being subject to drug screening and background checks.</p> <p>It should come as no surprise, then, that the community where children once waited for hours just to use playground equipment and where the requirements have become prohibitive for the thousands of residents who once lived in public housing has now lost many of the young people who might otherwise fill its classrooms. According to population reports from the University of Chicago’s Chapin Hall Center for Children, from 1990 to 1995, Bronzeville lost only two hundred and seventy two children. In the next five years, the community lost more than six thousand. In the five-year period after that, between 2000 and 2005, Bronzeville lost more than seven thousand six&nbsp;hundred children. Between 2005 and 2010, nearly another two thousand seven&nbsp;hundred moved away.</p> <p>A century ago, migrants from the South came to Bronzeville in search of the freedom that had remained so elusive even after the end of slavery. Undoubtedly, though they came with the hope for economic prosperity, they were also looking for that portion of the American dream that has always had a special salience for black people: a quality education. What they found in the nineteen-twenties was physical, psychic, and structural violence that pinned them into place. What their descendants found in the two thousands was displacement, first from their homes, then from their schools. When black Chicagoans of today sing “We shall not be moved,” it’s both a promise and a prayer.</p>\]\]></content:encoded>		</item>

 						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On a recent Friday, near twilight in the Bronzeville community of the South Side of Chicago, a group of protesters and their supporters marched from the national headquarters of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition to President Obama&#8217;s house. It’s not a long walk, but this crowd moved slowly. Parents pushed young children in strollers, and held the older ones by their hands. College students moved with a vigor that belied the solemnity of the march, which was organized to support the group of parents and community members that has been engaged in a hunger strike to re-open a local high school. Elders cautiously stepped down from the curb to uneven asphalt. Twice, a bus whizzed by on its evening route, finding space to pass even as the marchers took up a lane of traffic. Both times, the drivers honked and raised gloved fists, nodding in support. By the time the procession arrived at the corner across from the President&#8217;s home, the sun had fallen. A circle of protesters formed across from a line of cement barriers, watchful guards, an oversized black S.U.V., and a thick wall of shrubbery. As a police van passed, an old song rose from the circle: “We shall not, we shall not be moved / Just like a tree that&#8217;s planted by the water / We shall not be moved.”</p>]]></description>

For instance: Isn’t every discipline being honored a “creative art”? So how did “creative arts” become the going euphemism for “category so unimportant that it was dispensed with in an earlier ceremony, honoring winners who will now be insta-recycled as presenters for a more important award, if they even bother to show up.” (Margo Martindale, <em>where were you?</em>)</p> <p>Also: How is it that Uzo Aduba—not that hard to pronounce, Jamie Lee Curtis—managed to win as supporting actress in a drama series for the same character she played last year, when she won as supporting actress in a <em>comedy</em> series? Of course, part of the strength of “Orange Is the New Black” is its resistance to categorization. But, as I recall, last season Aduba’s character, Suzanne, a.k.a. Crazy Eyes, was being manipulated into self-worth by a mother figure who then used her as a pawn in a sociopathic power scheme. This season, she wrote alien erotica.</p> <p>Of all last night’s paradoxes, though, none was as urgent, as heartbreaking, or as beautifully expressed as what Viola Davis said late in the evening, after becoming the first African-American woman to win lead actress in a drama, for “How to Get Away with Murder.” “The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,” she said. “You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” For Davis, an Oscar nominee who nevertheless couldn’t find movie roles to sustain her gigantic talent, the line had personal weight. But it served as a critique of more structural problems, at once highlighting the wellspring of strong black actresses on television right now (including Aduba, Kerry Washington, and Taraji P. Henson) and hinting at the roles that still aren’t there for countless groups lacking representation in pop culture. It also recalled a moment earlier in the night, when Jill Soloway, the creator of “Transparent,” brought up the fact that housing discrimination based on gender identity is perfectly legal in most states. “We don’t have a trans tipping point yet,” she said. “We have a trans civil-rights problem.” Cultural representation is a force worth fighting for, but it only goes so far.</p> <p>Davis’s speech was one of several walloping moments that came in the final half-hour, after much tomfoolery. Jon Hamm, who managed to become this year’s Susan Lucci-style underdog, finally won an Emmy for his iconic role on “Mad Men,” after losing in the category seven times. Hamm slithered up on the stage, thigh first (ladies, he’s single), then gave a quietly emotional speech, in which he thanked “families who have chosen, for some reason, to take me in and be nice to me along this strange, strange road.” It was a reminder, perhaps, that Don Draper’s spiritual drift and isolation found its ideal expression in Hamm, who lost his mother when he was ten and his father when he was twenty. Or, as everyone on Twitter put it, “HAMM!”</p> <p>Another powerhouse moment closed the broadcast, as Tracy Morgan came on to award best drama series to “Game of Thrones,” his first time on a stage since the car crash that put him in an eight-day coma fifteen months ago. In a callback to Christopher Reeve’s moving appearance at the 1996 Academy Awards, Morgan said that he has finally started to “feel like myself again”—and, to prove the point, promised to get “a whole lotta women” pregnant at the after-party. Never before has a joke that blue been so warmly reassuring.</p> <p>These moments of gravitas aside, the night belonged to television’s hall of jesters, chief among them the host, Andy Samberg. In a strong opening number, Samberg sang an ode to one of the prevailing champagne problems of modern life: too many good TV shows to watch. “I’m just one man,” he sang. “How can I possibly keep up?” His opening monologue was also good, with barbs about series finales (“We also said goodbye to ‘True Detective,’ even though it’s still on the air”), Paul Giamatti (“every music manager in every movie ever”), and systemic racism and sexism—a counterweight to the fact that he, along with nearly everyone else who does joke monologues on TV these days, is a white guy.</p> <p>The Emmys continue to boast a sisterhood of funny women who compete year after year and still seem to support each other, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who won her fourth consecutive Emmy for “Veep,” and Amy Schumer, who lost the best actress in a comedy series award to Louis-Dreyfus but won for her series, “Inside Amy Schumer.” In a just world, there would have been prizes, too, for Lisa Kudrow (“The Comeback”) and Edie Falco (“Nurse Jackie”). As usual, there were a handful of “can’t be bothered with the Emmys” no-shows (Bill Murray, Emma Thompson). Also as usual, John Stamos and Rob Lowe are handsome in an eerily similar way. A good, long stretch of the broadcast was devoted to honoring the miniseries “Olive Kitteridge,” which you are now frantically using Andy Samberg’s HBO password to catch up on. Happily, this introduced the viewing audience to Jane Anderson, who wrote the screenplay, and who seems like the sprightly love child of Peter Pan and Tinkerbell. No matter that she thanked “Elizabeth Strauss” for writing the original novel (the author is Elizabeth Strout); her near-pirouette onto the stage in an orange gown that matched her hair was as delightful as her discombobulated wave goodbye as the music played her off. Someone cast this woman in a revival of “You Can’t Take It with You.”</p> <p>You know whom I feel sorry for? The “other” Ray Charles. Yes, the Emmy-winning composer, who died in April, at the ripe old age of ninety-six, may have called himself that. But still. Is the “In Memoriam” montage really the place for cheeky, self-deprecating nicknames? And how is the family of the other Uzo Aduba going to feel when her time comes? Another montage, of all the beloved shows that ended in the past year, indicated the wildly imaginative array of deaths that TV writers have in store for their protagonists, from stabbing by wooden stake to crushing by airborne piano. Fortunately, Jon Stewart survived his own finale to accept the award for best “variety talk series,” delivering the best speech of the night that can be classified as a comedy and not a drama. “I have been off of television for six weeks, seven weeks, whatever it is,” he said, with a silvery retirement beard to prove it. “This is the first applause I’ve heard. It is a barren wasteland out there.” Before promising that “you will never have to see me again”—to which everyone in America wailed back, “But we <em>waaant</em> to”—he bemoaned the lack of craft services out in the real world: “There are tables with food, but you can’t take it.” Another paradox.</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Sometime in the middle hour of last night’s Emmy Awards—the hour in which you might have realized, more than a year behind schedule, that Adrien Brody played Houdini in a History channel miniseries—John Oliver made an extremely valid point. “A limited series is, of course, a series that only runs for a limited time,” he said, presenting the award for best direction of a “limited series, movie, or dramatic special.” “Although, let’s be honest, pretty much every series is a ‘limited series.’ Every show on television will go off the air eventually, with the sole exception of ‘Jeopardy!’ ”</p> <p>As the broadcast went along, a few other award-show truisms, paradoxes, koans, and Catch-22s came to mind.

He begged off. Carnival in Jamaica wasn’t anything special, and it was prohibitively expensive for all but the very wealthy to play <em>mas</em>. The drunken revelries of the costumed élites, he said, were protected from the crowds by dividers and police patrols. Regular people could only watch from the sidelines.</p> <p>Brooklyn Carnival is still democratic, and with democracy comes chaos. On Labor Day, the annual West Indian Day Parade transformed Eastern Parkway into a bright and beautiful pageant that has become one of Brooklyn’s most beloved traditions. But in Brooklyn, as in the islands, pretty <em>mas</em> is preceded by the <em>dutty mas</em> of Jouvert, a celebration that begins at 4 A.M. and ends at sunrise. Shortly after dawn, the streets still belonged to celebrants anointed with motor oil, paint, mud, and baby powder. Hours earlier, a man I might have known danced me away from my friends and into the faerie pull of the masquerade.</p> <p>Then morning came, dissipating some of the collective fog. People began to pick themselves up off the sidewalks and head home for a brief respite before the big parade. I realized that I was drenched in grease, like a pelican casualty of Exxon Valdez, and was missing my wallet, keys, and cell phone. But I was only a few blocks from my apartment and had emerged from the night unscathed.</p> <p>Others were not so lucky. Over the course of Sunday and Monday, in the precincts where people gather for West Indian Carnival, three people were shot and two were stabbed; two of the victims were fatally wounded. The total arrests included thirteen for gun possession, four felony assaults, fourteen misdemeanors, one robbery, three for the possession of deadly weapons (two knives and a machete), and one for disorderly conduct.</p> <p>One of the men shot was Carey Gabay, the forty-three-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants, and a lawyer in Governor Cuomo’s administration. Gabay died from his injuries on Wednesday evening, more than a week after he was injured. His shooting, which authorities said occurred when an unknown gunman shot into a crowd of revelers, brought the obscure tradition of Jouvert into the national spotlight and kindled yet another debate about gun violence. Cuomo appeared on the news lamenting his aide’s bad fortune. A chorus of commentators called for the banning of Jouvert. <em>Crain’s</em> published an online poll asking, “Should the city end the West Indian American Day festivities to curb violence?” Fifty-six per cent of respondents said yes.</p> <p>That Thursday, the leaders of J’Ouvert City International, a community group that has organized&nbsp;the event since the nineteen-eighties, and the West Indian American Day Carnival Association, which oversees the parade itself, had a closed-door meeting with Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams, the N.Y.P.D., and city council members. Afterward, Adams announced the creation of a task force that would address violence not just at Jouvert but at New York City events in general. Jouvert was not in jeopardy. “We don’t stop celebrating the Fourth of July because some crazy breaks out a gun,” Adams said. The shooting of Gabay, who at that point was still hospitalized, in critical condition, was discussed at length. The death of the other, unnamed young man was mentioned in passing.</p> <p>The next day, I spoke to Adams. “Statistically, if you look at what happened over the weekend, those are not high numbers compared to a central Brooklyn standard,” he said, about the crime at Jouvert.&nbsp;I asked him about the <em>Crain’s</em> poll. The people who read <em>Crain’s</em>, he said, are not among the million who go out each year to the Parkway. “Brooklyn is ground zero for gentrification. There are a small number of newcomers who want to know why they have to deal with this. Then why did you come here?”</p> <p>I asked him if he thought there was a racial element to the anger about Jouvert. “It was hysteria. We didn’t even know what they were calling for the end to. We can’t continue to be irrational about these events because of the economics, the ethnicity, or the location.” He said that if the numbers had shown there was systemic violence attached to Jouvert, he would act differently. As for the second man who had been killed, they were trying to contact his family.</p> <p>Adams said that W.I.A.D.C.A. and J’Ouvert City could not continue to operate separately, but that that he wouldn’t introduce any measures that might compromise Jouvert. “Jouvert is Brooklyn,” he said. “We can’t corral the people into a small area. We can’t change the spirit of it.”</p> <p>From its inception, West Indian Carnival has been defined by policing as much as celebration. In the late eighteenth century, French colonists emigrating from Haiti introduced elaborate balls and masquerade traditions to Trinidad. One of these was Canboulay (from <em>cannes brulées</em>, or “burnt cane”), a mocking reënactment of the burning of the sugar cane in which participants costumed themselves as slaves. After the British Empire abolished slavery, in 1838, newly freed blacks took up Canboulay as their own, coöpting and subverting the <em>mas</em> celebrations of former masters. In 1881, riots broke out when the British constabulary attempted to shut down Canboulay. Two years later, colonial authorities tried again, this time with an ordinance banning the music of drums, the heartbeat of Carnival. Canboulay endured, and came to symbolize not just freedom but victory. Jouvert (“breaking dawn”) is Canboulay’s spiritual successor.</p> <p>In Brooklyn, too, Jouvert endures despite antagonism between players and the police. In 1994, residents founded J’Ouvert City to “not only protect and promote the tradition of J’Ouvert but to also protect the paraders and numerous steel-band orchestras from clashes with the police.” I spoke with Yvette Rennie, one of the group’s leaders, after the press conference on Thursday. Rennie, who was born in Trinidad, came to the U.S. in the nineteen-sixties. She spoke quietly but firmly about violence at Jouvert. “Our Jouvert was always a success until Brooklyn lost control of guns. Until America lost control of guns.”</p> <p>William Howard, first vice-president of W.I.A.D.C.A. fields countless phone calls every year from the press and politicians about the depraved and deadly antics plaguing Jouvert, and every year he must reiterate that his group has nothing to do with the pre-dawn parade or its organizers. By the Wednesday after Labor Day, W.I.A.D.C.A. had been besieged by requests from “every politician under the moon,” or at least by every politician in Brooklyn, who wanted a chance to stump about gun violence.</p> <p>It’s an unfair burden. The West Indian Day Parade has become respectable (no one is shocked, any longer, by the spectacle of nearly naked women gyrating down Eastern Parkway). And W.I.A.D.C.A. is a deeply rooted community organization committed to Caribbean life in Brooklyn, and a primary connection for many residents to the islands they have left behind. It’s also, in Howard’s words, “New York City’s biggest babysitter”—under its auspices, thousands of kids spend their summers learning to play the steel drums, or building costumes and learning choreography and storylines for the intricate theatrics of pretty <em>mas</em>.</p> <p>The organization’s relations with the N.Y.P.D. have been friendly since the Giuliani era, when Mayor Rudy finally recognized the huge economic boon Carnival brings to the city each Labor Day weekend. Howard has lobbied for increased police presence at the parade to protect participants, local spectators, tourists, venders, and V.I.P.s—including Mayor de Blasio, “that Facebook lady,” (Maxine Williams, the company’s diversity director and a grand marshal), and high-ranking government representatives from Haiti, Trinidad, Jamaica, and Barbados. W.I.A.D.C.A. needs police coöperation not just to maintain law and order but also to put a safe and friendly face on the parade, and, hopefully, to burnish its reputation with government and corporate sponsors. Police commissioner Bill Bratton and former commissioner Ray Kelly have supported Howard’s efforts. A few years ago, Kelly and other members of the force hopped on a float and performed in their own steel-drum band.</p> <p>Howard, who is not of Caribbean origin, was introduced to Carnival five decades ago, by the late Brooklyn congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who had roots in Barbados. Howard worked as Chisholm’s chief treasurer, and helped lead the successful campaign for a U.S. postage stamp honoring her achievements. He sees Carnival as vital to her legacy and to the preservation of black and West Indian cultural life in Brooklyn. “When John F. Kennedy came to Brooklyn during his Presidential campaign, he stopped at Nostrand and Fulton, and the closest I could get was a few blocks over at Halsey,” Howard told me. “Now Presidential candidates don’t come through Bed-Stuy.”</p> <p>Howard’s primary concerns, though, remain logistical. “If someone gave us a million dollars, I would retire. I’ve stuck around for forty-eight years because this is the best thing Caribbean people have here, and maybe the last thing black people have in Brooklyn.”</p>\]\]></description>			<content:encoded><!\[CDATA\[<p>Last April, on a trip to Kingston, I asked a friend from Trinidad if he would accompany me to Jamaican Carnival.

It is natural to deplore Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric as he has emerged as a surprise Republican front-runner in the 2016 Presidential race. But clearly America’s long-standing racial orthodoxy, premised on a white majority’s overdue acknowledgment of non-white disadvantage, is gradually losing its legitimacy. The demographics of the United States are shifting, and the Trump supporters interviewed by Osnos were responding to this with dread and hostility. They may be angry and afraid, but they don’t seem merely ignorant; Trump’s candidacy may be an outrage, but the tensions it reveals cannot be wished away.

While I have long suspected that Trump’s popularity with many voters is due in part to the way he appeals to racists and xenophobes, it was appalling to read the quotes from leaders in America’s burgeoning white-supremacist movement, in which they declare their support for his Presidential campaign. At the same time, I was disappointed that <em>The</em> <em>New Yorker</em> decided to allow them to use their preferred terminology in identifying themselves—“white nationalist,” rather than “white supremacist.” White supremacists might like to say that they are white nationalists in order to distance themselves from the historical connotations of white supremacy, imply that their cause is merely patriotic and concerned with rights, or suggest that white people worldwide belong to one nation, but it seems apparent that what they promote is, in fact, white supremacy.

But, as Kashua says to Margalit, he “couldn’t do humor anymore.” I moved to Israel as an idealistic young woman, and my own children were born in Jerusalem, just after the occupation began. I never suffered the pervasive discrimination that Kashua did, but my reasons for leaving were similar to his: I could have avoided the glaring inequality for a while, but I could not lie to my children.

It was rusted, its black paint was chipped, and it had been marked by several dogs. “I could do the top in green and the rest in black, or I could alternate green and black every other bar,” he said. He wore sneakers and work gloves, and carried a canvas bag filled with brushes and cans of paint. “Or I could throw in some red. I’m not van Gogh over here, but it’s fun to get creative.”</p> <p>He approached a woman sitting on a nearby bench and solicited her opinion. “I’d go with all black,” she said. “I’m pretty simple.”</p> <p>“I’m a very complex guy,” Hodges said. “You and I could never get married.”</p> <p>There was an awkward silence. “Do you mind if I ask what you’re doing?” the woman said.</p> <p>“I see things that need touching up, and I come out here and touch them up,” Hodges said.</p> <p>“Could you get in trouble?” she asked.</p> <p>“There’s a law against defacing public property,” Hodges said. “Does it look like I’m defacing?”</p> <p>“It looks like you’re painstakingly improving,” she said.</p> <p>“That’s what I think,” he said, dipping a brush in a can of turpentine.</p> <p>Hodges is sixty and has lived in Brooklyn Heights since 1978.

It was rusted, its black paint was chipped, and it had been marked by several dogs. “I could do the top in green and the rest in black, or I could alternate green and black every other bar,” he said. He wore sneakers and work gloves, and carried a canvas bag filled with brushes and cans of paint. “Or I could throw in some red. I’m not van Gogh over here, but it’s fun to get creative.”</p> <p>He approached a woman sitting on a nearby bench and solicited her opinion. “I’d go with all black,” she said. “I’m pretty simple.”</p> <p>“I’m a very complex guy,” Hodges said. “You and I could never get married.”</p> <p>There was an awkward silence. “Do you mind if I ask what you’re doing?” the woman said.</p> <p>“I see things that need touching up, and I come out here and touch them up,” Hodges said.</p> <p>“Could you get in trouble?” she asked.</p> <p>“There’s a law against defacing public property,” Hodges said. “Does it look like I’m defacing?”</p> <p>“It looks like you’re painstakingly improving,” she said.</p> <p>“That’s what I think,” he said, dipping a brush in a can of turpentine.</p> <p>Hodges is sixty and has lived in Brooklyn Heights since 1978.
