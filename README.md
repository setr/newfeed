# I HATE MOBILE WEB BROWSING
# BUT I LIKE MY RSS READER

This script currently only works for thenewyorker.com

It is meant to fetch the rss feed, then go to each article and grab the full textual content, and plug it back to the rss feed

finally, the new feed gets hosted at setr.github.io/newfeed.rss, which can be subscribed to on my RSS reader.

Thus, I obtain everything, have auto-fetching and caching from my reader, and don't have to worry about ads and whatever other garbage they want to visit their site for.
