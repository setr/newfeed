		<title>Telling the Truth About ISIS and Raqqa</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On Saturday night, five young Syrians slouched into a dive bar in New York and ordered drinks. When the bartender asked if off-brand vodka was O.K., they had to smile. They were all exiles from Raqqa, the provincial city in northern Syria that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/isis-after-paris">ISIS</a> has made its operational center and the de-facto capital of the Islamic State. No one needed the good stuff. Just a drink would do.</p>]]></description>

		<title>Belgian Terror: Brussels on Lockdown</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On Saturday, Brussels was essentially shut down, as the Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel warned that the threat of a terror attack was “serious and imminent.” Metal shutters and gates blocked entrances to the metro system, and locals were warned to avoid concerts, train stations, shopping malls, and other venues that see large gatherings. All restaurants and cafés were closed by 6 P.M. Armored vehicles rolled through the streets. Soldiers patrolled in pairs, guarding public spaces and hotels. Michel said that the decision to lock down this city of more than a million inhabitants was “based on quite precise information about the risk of an attack like the one that happened in Paris.” He clarified that the government believed that “several individuals with arms and explosives” might attack the Belgian capital, “perhaps even in several places at the same time.”</p>]]></description>

		<title>Boundaries and Renewal in Bosnia</title>
		<description><![CDATA[ <p class="descender">In November, 1995, the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/09/20/the-next-war-2">Dayton Peace Agreement</a> brought the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bosnias-unending-war">Bosnian War</a> to a halt by formally dividing up the country among the warring parties. Diplomats accorded about half the territory to the Bosnian Serbs, and the other half to the Bosniaks (Muslims) and the Bosnian Croats. According to the agreement, the parties controlling these two “entities”—Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina—would have to govern them together as one tenuous nation. In 1996, when the two sides were still reeling from war, NATO peacekeepers rimmed the border between them, which was a former frontline, and there was little civilian transportation crossing back and forth. Today, the internal frontier is largely invisible—you can see on a map that the boundary ripples along in a rough parallel to Bosnia’s border, scything out a partition, but there are no actual controls or customs in place; the verdant hills of the Bosnian terrain appear to rise endlessly before you in one continuous whole. And yet, the boundary still exists. While on a reporting trip in the country this summer, I needed to travel between two major cities in the north, Banja Luka and Tuzla, but was told that taking public transport between them was difficult, as they lie on opposite sides of the entity lines—the main bus company didn’t even cover the route, and there were a few smaller lines that went only late at night. It might even be easier to trace my way back five hours south to Sarajevo, the capital, and depart northward again from there.</p>]]></description>

		<title>Mali’s Hotel Hostage Siege</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">The Radisson Blu hotel, in Bamako, Mali, is the city’s finest: peach-colored brick, with a swirling pool and sleek, minimalist rooms. As in other West African capitals, like Dakar and Lagos, the Radisson Blu is a popular spot for the local business and political élite, and also for travellers and expatriates—an immense amount of wealth and privilege concentrated in a seven-story hotel. So when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/world/africa/mali-hotel-attack-radisson.html?hp&#38;action=click&#38;pgtype=Homepage&#38;clickSource=story-heading&#38;module=a-lede-package-region&#38;region=top-news&#38;WT.nav=top-news">militants invaded the hotel</a>, earlier today, taking some hundred and seventy hostages, the meaning of their strike was clear. Al Mourabitoun, an Islamist group that has branded itself as Al Qaeda in West Africa and is based in the desert of northern Mali, claimed responsibility for the siege. As of now, the death toll is twenty-seven, including two terrorists. After most of the hostages escaped, the battle between Malian troops, assisted by French special forces, and the gunmen, who were holed up in the hotel’s top floors, went on for several hours.</p>]]></description>

		<title>Terror in Mali</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Today&#8217;s hostage crisis at the Radisson Blu Hotel, in the Malian capital of Bamako, where about a hundred people were held, has ended, with as many as twenty-seven deaths, according to a United Nations official. A joint operation by U.S. and Malian special forces ended the attack, which underscores the escalating pace of terrorist assaults by Islamist extremists. Coming so soon after the ISIS rampage in Paris, last Friday; the bombings in Beirut, a day earlier; and the downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt, on October 31st, this raid appears to have been an attempt by Al Mourabitoun, a largely Malian extremist group, to grab its own headlines. Most of these attacks have been on soft targets, where large numbers of civilians can be killed, and on secular Westerners, or infidels, in the eyes of the extremists. Others, of course, have targeted Muslims, such as last week&#8217;s Beirut bombings, which were intended to kill Shiites, who are vilified as apostates by the Sunni Muslim extremists of ISIS.</p>]]></description>

		<title>These So-Called Bad Movies Prove the Urgency of Film Criticism</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">One of the great last lines in movie history is from the 1947 film noir “Nightmare Alley,” when two supporting characters catch a glimpse of the fallen hero: “How can a guy get so low?” “He reached too high.” That’s the story of one of the year’s best repertory series, “<a href="http://www.bam.org/film/2015/turkeys-for-thanksgiving">Turkeys for Thanksgiving</a>,” playing at BAM today through November 29th, which showcases films of great ambition that have ended up among the most reviled in the history of cinema largely because of those vast ambitions, which critics took pleasure in deriding.</p>]]></description>

		<title>Our Betrayal of Syrian and Iraqi Refugees</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">This week, David Bowers, the Democratic mayor of Roanoke, Virginia, invoked the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War as justification for keeping out Iraqi and Syrian refugees. I wonder if the mayor (who later apologized to anyone he might have offended) would have paused for one second in his headlong rush to join the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-and-americas-muslims">anti-refugee hysteria</a> sweeping America if he’d known that, among the residents of his city, there’s an Iraqi named Hayder. In 2003, Hayder was working as an interpreter for the 82nd Airborne Division, in Baghdad, when his convoy was ambushed by insurgents. Dragging an American sergeant out of the line of fire, Hayder was hit in both legs and nearly killed. He lost most of his right leg. Unable to work and in danger for his life, he fled Iraq with his wife and son to Jordan, where the family languished for years in deepening misery while getting nowhere in their efforts to get visas to the United States. Finally, in 2007, his case came to the attention of <a href="http://kirkwjohnson.com/">Kirk Johnson</a>, an American refugee advocate, and the next year Hayder and his family were resettled in Roanoke. In 2013, he became a U.S. citizen.</p>]]></description>

		<title>Textbooks for Peace in Israel and the West Bank</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">A small, sad record was set on Thursday, for the largest number of deaths in a single day in the two-month rash of scattered attacks by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank. Five people died, two by stabbing in Tel Aviv and three by automatic gunfire near Alon Shvut, a Jewish settlement. In the shadow of the attacks in Paris, however, this everyday violence has slipped nearly out of sight. It has become so routine that it remains in our peripheral vision.</p>]]></description>
