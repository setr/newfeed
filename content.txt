						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">For decades, any mention of his name made you smile. Yogi Berra was great and sweet, a bent, short, famous old guy with a gap-toothed smile. Raising an arm again to our cheering while he made his way to the plate or the mound for another pregame ceremonial moment, with Whitey and Moose and Phil and the rest awaiting him, he tapped the syrupy strain of affection that tastes also of Elvis and Goofy and Chekhov. When we sat down again, somebody in the next seat would be saying, “When you get to a fork in the road, take it,” or “It gets late early out there,” or some other Yogi-ism that would keep the candied moment going. Berra, who died yesterday, played for the Yankees for eighteen seasons and the Mets for one, compiling a .285 batting average, with three hundred and fifty-eight home runs and fourteen hundred and thirty runs batted in. His postseason marks were equally impressive—seventy-one hits, thirty-nine R.B.I.s, and twelve homers—but even these figures feel legendary in sum and slightly distance us from the kind of player and man he was. There is a hovering temptation, for instance, to dismiss his World Series figures a little, because they depend so much on the Yankees’ repeated presence in the classic. But this is patronizing and unfair. Given his chances, Yogi hit them out of sight. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/sports/baseball/yogi-berra-dies-at-90-yankees-baseball-catcher.html?_r=0" target="_blank">The Times’s splendid obituary</a>, by Bruce Weber, does the right thing. It carefully compares Berra’s over-all lifetime stats as a catcher to those of a prior Hall of Fame Yankees catcher, Bill Dickey, and shows, I think, that Yogi was the better backstop. It also brings in Johnny Bench, and clarifies our thinking about the best catcher ever.</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On Sunday night, Mets fans got their first in-person glimpse of the Matt Harvey Dilemma, and the results had to leave them more than a little anxious. Harvey, the twenty-six-year-old ace of the Mets staff, is nearing the end of his first season since coming back from Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, which kept him from pitching in 2014. Earlier this month, Harvey’s agent, Scott Boras, told members of the media that the medically responsible thing for the Mets to do would be to follow a hard innings limit with his client. He claimed that Harvey’s surgeon had set a ceiling of a hundred and eighty innings, after which, Boras argued, the Mets should shut Harvey down for the year.</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">It was an unseasonably warm night in Chicago. On Tuesday, November 4, 2008, nearly a quarter of a million people—young and old, men and women of almost every racial and ethnic background—streamed into Grant Park. The crowd was peaceful and somewhat subdued, filled with a jittery anticipation about how the night would likely unfold. Shortly after 10 P.M. Central Standard Time, television networks announced that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/17/the-joshua-generation">Barack Obama had been elected</a> the forty-fourth President of the United States. For a few seconds, the crowd stood still, in a stunned silence. Then, the crowd let out a collective and euphoric scream. There was joy, relief, and disbelief. Tears flowed freely, strangers hugged for several minutes, others knelt and prayed. Senator John McCain’s concession speech put Obama’s election into its historic context by reminding Americans that just a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt had been vilified for inviting Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House. Obama’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K8GWCl7P7U">victory speech</a> took the high-spirited crowd even higher: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” I called my cousin, who was too filled with emotion and too mystified to complete her thought: “This country . . .

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">In November, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower was mulling a matter that he mulled with some frequency: the effects of age on someone in a stressful, non-stop job like his. He’d been President for nearly two years and, in his diary, wrote down some of the reasons why seeking a second term might be a bad idea: “The greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50,” a need for “younger men in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize the youth, vigor and virility of the Republican Party,” and, perhaps above all, the “growing severity and complexity of problems that rest upon the President for solution.” As far as he knew, he was in good shape, but intimations of mortality shadowed him, and he thought a lot about the next political generation. At a White House political dinner a few days before Christmas, he said, “We have got to begin right now, at the state level and at the precinct level, to see to it that the Party puts up the right kind of young man to run in ’56. All the programs in the world, and all the Eisenhower prestige, cannot elect some revolting old Republican hack against a youthful, able, and personable Democrat.”</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Last week at BAM, Isabella Rossellini co-starred, with Jeremy Irons, in a live tribute to her mother, Ingrid Bergman. The event began BAM’s Ingrid Bergman centenary film festival, which continues through Saturday. It rounds up the usual suspects— “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vThuwa5RZU">Casablanca</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8f4UOtLf5Q">Notorious</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLfQU2xmg">Gaslight</a>” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIBaGIUbXqI">Spellbound</a>”—along with early Swedish dramas; two of the films Bergman made with Isabella’s father, Roberto Rossellini, “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-europa-51">Europa ’51</a>” and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-voyage-to-italy">“Journey to Italy</a>”; Ingmar Bergman’s “Autumn Sonata”; “Murder on the Orient Express,” for which she won her third Oscar; and others. Before an afternoon rehearsal for the tribute, Rossellini, sitting on a couch in the elegant green room at BAM, talked about her impulse to preserve her parents’ work. “Does it have to be preserved?” she asked. “I remember talking to Bernardo Bertolucci, and he said, ‘I believe in the mandala, I believe I’m a little bit of a Buddhist. I believe that things are impermanent.’ ” Rossellini’s accent—as many of us have observed over the years, in everything from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHFk0Asaxuo">Blue Velvet</a>” to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve31XhpaPRU">30 Rock</a>” to “<a href="http://www.sundance.tv/series/green-porno/videos/praying-mantis-green-porno-season-1">Green Porno</a>”— is like her mother’s, with a little something extra. “And then I speak to Martin Scorsese, with whom I was married, and he says, ‘Rock and roll and films—this is the culture that has characterized our century the most.’ We have to preserve all of it.”</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Last Wednesday, toward the beginning of a speech in Washington, D.C., Cornell Brooks, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, invoked Scripture. “God gave these words to Joshua: ‘Be strong and of good courage,’ ” Brooks said. He was standing on a lawn just north of the Capitol, addressing a crowd of several hundred supporters, some of whom, the previous afternoon, had completed a forty-six-day, thousand-mile march from Selma, Alabama, in support of voting rights. America’s Journey for Justice, as the march was called, had traversed five states. Each of them, Brooks had said at an earlier event, was rendered “civically naked and unprotected” by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2013. In that decision, Shelby County v.

						<description><![CDATA[ <p class="descender">The late senator Ted Stevens, of Alaska, took flak for calling the Internet “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE">a series of tubes</a>,” but his phrase, however analog, hits on a truth that we frequently forget: there is a physical infrastructure undergirding our seemingly ethereal global network. The most important component of this plumbing is a cat’s cradle of undersea cables.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p class="descender">The late senator Ted Stevens, of Alaska, took flak for calling the Internet “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE">a series of tubes</a>,” but his phrase, however analog, hits on a truth that we frequently forget: there is a physical infrastructure undergirding our seemingly ethereal global network. The most important component of this plumbing is a cat’s cradle of undersea cables. In the decades since the first transatlantic fibre-optic telephone line was laid, in 1988, such cables have multiplied and spread as bandwidth demands have grown. There are currently <a href="http://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/">three hundred and forty-three</a> of them already active or under construction, and they run more than half a million miles, traversing every ocean and connecting every continent except Antarctica, running up and down the coasts of Africa, through the Hawaiian Islands, and up into Alaska and Greenland.

According to the rapturous response on the Internet, Carson’s remarks were a rebuke of President Obama—people saw Carson as an authentic black counterpoint to the President—but they were just as clearly a rejection of what he called the culture of “political correctness.” “The P.C. police are out in force,” he warned from the podium. “We’ve reached a point where people are afraid to say what they think because someone might be offended.

Round up the usual suspects.” And also: “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”</p><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-godfather-at-the-philharmonic?mbid=rss">See the rest of the story at newyorker.com</a></p>Related:<br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/straight-outta-compton-is-straight-outta-2015">“Straight Outta Compton” Is Straight Outta 2015</a><br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/just-let-marlon-brando-talk">Just Let Marlon Brando Talk</a><br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/southpaw-is-a-throwback-in-the-worst-way">“Southpaw” Is a Throwback—in the Worst Way</a><br />]]></content:encoded>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">In case anybody noticed, Matt Harvey pitched pretty well for the Mets last night—five innings, one hit, seven strikeouts—but the outing was hustled aside by its termination. For days, we’d heard that Harvey’s innings and pitch counts would be the main event in this series against the Yankees, and were reminded that his recovering, Tommy-Johned elbow, and his hovering famous agent, and the weighing of the Mets’ rotation and their playoff status and games-ahead and prospects of passing the Dodgers, versus Matt’s long-term obligations and his contract, was to be a major part, or perhaps the major part, of this ballgame. And so it turned out, it seemed, when we had to wonder whatever Manager Terry Collins—his back turned to us there in the dugout—was saying to his ace, as he explained the derricking, in the middle of the fifth, with Harvey sadly nodding, yeah, Skip, I know, I know. The rest of the Mets seemed distracted as well. Harvey’s replacement, Hansel Robles, was ill-served by two successive infield errors before surrendering a double to Carlos Beltrán and then three runs more.</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On a recent Friday, near twilight in the Bronzeville community of the South Side of Chicago, a group of protesters and their supporters marched from the national headquarters of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition to President Obama&#8217;s house. It’s not a long walk, but this crowd moved slowly. Parents pushed young children in strollers, and held the older ones by their hands. College students moved with a vigor that belied the solemnity of the march, which was organized to support the group of parents and community members that has been engaged in a hunger strike to re-open a local high school. Elders cautiously stepped down from the curb to uneven asphalt. Twice, a bus whizzed by on its evening route, finding space to pass even as the marchers took up a lane of traffic. Both times, the drivers honked and raised gloved fists, nodding in support. By the time the procession arrived at the corner across from the President&#8217;s home, the sun had fallen. A circle of protesters formed across from a line of cement barriers, watchful guards, an oversized black S.U.V., and a thick wall of shrubbery. As a police van passed, an old song rose from the circle: “We shall not, we shall not be moved / Just like a tree that&#8217;s planted by the water / We shall not be moved.”</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Last April, on a trip to Kingston, I asked a friend from Trinidad if he would accompany me to Jamaican Carnival. He begged off.

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">“I make up for my lack of skills at any sport with enthusiasm for watching,” Mark Ulriksen says of “Streetball,” his cover for this week’s issue. “I’ve done a lot of baseball imagery, so I thought, Let’s do something with basketball. Basketball players are tall and lean, like the buildings in Manhattan, and New York is famous for basketball games in pickup playgrounds. I wanted to combine different buildings from Midtown or Brooklyn or the Bronx. But, also, I really like images of people suspended in air, and that was the genesis of the idea.”</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[ Trump’s Supporters <p>I read the Evan Osnos piece about Donald Trump and his white-nationalist fans with interest (“The Fearful and the Frustrated,” August 31st). It is natural to deplore Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric as he has emerged as a surprise Republican front-runner in the 2016 Presidential race. But clearly America’s long-standing racial orthodoxy, premised on a white majority’s overdue acknowledgment of non-white disadvantage, is gradually losing its legitimacy. The demographics of the United States are shifting, and the Trump supporters interviewed by Osnos were responding to this with dread and hostility. They may be angry and afraid, but they don’t seem merely ignorant; Trump’s candidacy may be an outrage, but the tensions it reveals cannot be wished away. Eventually, even the most moderate politicians will be obliged to address the concerns of a discrete white community whose comfortable social privileges are no longer a given.</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On a balmy Sunday not long ago, Sewall Hodges stood on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, paintbrush in hand, regarding a garbage can. It was rusted, its black paint was chipped, and it had been marked by several dogs. “I could do the top in green and the rest in black, or I could alternate green and black every other bar,” he said. He wore sneakers and work gloves, and carried a canvas bag filled with brushes and cans of paint. “Or I could throw in some red. I’m not van Gogh over here, but it’s fun to get creative.”</p>]]></description>
