            <p><span><span class="dropcap">C</span>an a person who is biologically male really </span><i>be</i><span> female? What about someone who is born white but doesn’t feel that way—can she </span><i>become</i><span> black? Intelligent adults can disagree passionately on these questions of identity, as evident in the back-and-forth discussion over the recent cases of Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, and Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who identified as African American.</span></p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Rachel%20Dolezal" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7681_d367eef13f90793bd8121e2f675f0dc2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Rachel Dolezal projected a different racial identity as an adult (left) than as a child (right).</figcaption></figure> <p>If social categories like gender and race stir up so much controversy among adults, think how confusing they must be for children to sort out. As it turns out, how children form social categories can teach us something about the malleability of these categories and what children learn from the way we talk about them.</p><p>Categories allow us to group together stable properties and make useful predictions—we distinguish apples from oranges because once we identify something as an apple, we can expect that it will taste good in a pie, that its peel can be eaten, and that it will grow under certain conditions. The same is true of social categories. But a small child is faced with a daunting task: Which of the many differences that that arise among humans—skin color, hair color, hair length, clothing, accent, height, etc.—are useful cues for grouping people together in ways that predict their behavior or social status?</p><p>The distinctions that seem most essential to adults are not so obvious to a child. For example, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01101.x/abstract" target="_blank">a study</a> led by psychologist Katherine Kinzler found that at the age of 5 or 6, white American kids thought it more likely that a white child could grow up to be a black adult (and vice versa) than that an English-speaking child could grow up to speak French. (By age 9 or 10, this relationship had flipped, and they viewed race as a more stable property than language.) Far from being innate, social categories are learned in ways that reflect a child’s context: For black children, race was more connected with identity than language was, even at age 5–6. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3714352/" target="_blank">A similar study of Israeli children</a> found that at this age, children saw ethnicity—that is, the distinction between Jewish and Arabic people, as signaled by clothing—as a stable and objective category, more so than race.</p><p>How do kids learn to form these categories? One of the important factors is the nouns used in their languages. Notice that we have nouns like <i>Jews</i>, <i>blacks</i>, or <i>gays</i>, but none to express categories such as people who rarely wear socks or those who have pendulous earlobes. Nouns serve as powerful invitations to create categories—they signal that things that are labeled with the same noun (e.g., <i>cats</i>) are similar to each other along many dimensions and different from things that have a different name (e.g., <i>dogs</i>).</p><p>There’s strong evidence that noun labels encourage children to form categories, including (and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12130/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=" target="_blank">perhaps especially</a>) ones that apply to people, leading them to treat members of a category as similar to each other. For example, psychologist Sandra Waxman found that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.732/abstract" target="_blank">category names prompted children to make </a><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.732/abstract" target="_blank">up generalizations</a> about people within a racial or gender category. She showed 4-year-old children a photo of a person, informing them that this person was good at a new game called zaggit. She then showed them photos of men and women of different races and asked who among them was also good at playing zaggit. In the absence of a label, children showed no inclination to believe that excellence at the game was limited to people of the same race or gender. But when the zaggit player was given a label (“This one is a Wayshian”), children said that people of the same race or gender were more likely to be good at the game than those of a different race or gender.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15248372.2012.742902" target="_blank">follow-up study</a> used cartoon characters to see how children might form completely new social categories and found that noun labels, even in the absence of any visible physical features, were enough to encourage children to generalize traits based on group membership; on the other hand, without labels attached, physical features such as skin color or hat color were not. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01525.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=" target="_blank">Another study</a> underscored the importance of language by showing that children generalized traits especially eagerly when category names appeared in what linguists call “generic statements”—for example, “boys are good at math” rather than “these boys are good at math.”</p><p>Beliefs about differences between genders, ethnicities, or races often stretch far beyond any credible evidence, fueling stereotypes and discrimination. Some scientists believe that language plays a key role in imprinting us with such beliefs. In <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12235/abstract;jsessi target=">a recent Israeli study</a>, researchers recorded parents’ conversations with their 5-year-old children as they looked at a picture book with Arabic and Jewish characters, and noted how often parents used ethnic labels (“an Arab” or “Jews”) or generic statements (“Arabs have big families”). They also tested the extent to which the children and adults believed that Jewish and Arabic people were different from each other in essential ways that persisted over time, with traits that were inherited from one generation to the next. Parents who believed in fundamental differences between the groups used more labels and generic statements, and their children in turn were more likely to believe in deep, immutable distinctions. A statistical analysis showed that parents’ language patterns affected the children’s beliefs <i>even more</i><i> than the </i><i>parents’</i><i> actual attitudes</i>.</p><p>Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that we adults have such a hard time agreeing on what it means to be black, or female, or Muslim. After all, each of us has bathed in different linguistic waters and experienced the meanings of these categories in different ways.</p> <p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Julie Sedivy has taught linguistics and psychology at Brown University and the University of Calgary.

            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the first lines of Sophocles’ <i>Antigone,</i> the title character bemoans her fate to the chorus:</p> <div><p>How many miseries our father caused!<br/>And is there one of them that does not fall<br/>On us while yet we live?</p></div> <p>Antigone must reckon with the choices her father Oedipus made and the slippery, obscure moral inheritance that he leaves her. She ultimately chooses to pay with her life, not for her sins, but for her father’s.</p> <p>Children reckoning with and reenacting the sins of their forebears is a key part of the tragic form. The great Greek tragedians—Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides—incorporated ancestral fault into their works, as Orestes, Electra, and Antigone reap what their powerful but monumentally flawed parents sow. The Greeks took the idea of moral inheritance well past the stage, weaving it into the fabric of their society, from elegiac poetry to philosophical treatises to medical literature. Ancient Greek philosophers like Hermias and Proclus were known to have used medical imagery to illustrate the concept of delayed punishment.<sup>1</sup></p> <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The data are showing us that descendants undoubtedly bear the imprints of ancestral violence.</p> </blockquote><p><span>In the ensuing centuries, belief in hereditary curses was gradually replaced by newer religions, philosophies, and dogmas. In the West, the idea of inheritable sin was first subsumed by the Christian tenet of original sin, and then mostly discarded by Enlightenment ideals of rationality and personal liberty. While we were encouraged to understand our parents’ histories, our future was our own to create. Curses became a thing of the past.</span><br/></p> <p>Ironically, though, new life is being breathed into the idea of the hereditary curse by one of the highest achievements of the Enlightenment: modern science.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Mariani_BR" data-title="Preparing%20patricide" data-capper="In%20the%20Greek%20tragedy%20Electra%2C%20Clytemnestra%20murders%20her%20husband%20Agamemnon.%20Her%20son%2C%20Orestes%2C%20eventually%20takes%20revenge%20by%20killing%20her.%20" data-credits="Wikimedia"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7647_767c23430487b6c64d45b83d5d32e9a1.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Preparing patricide:</strong> In the Greek tragedy Electra, Clytemnestra murders her husband Agamemnon.

He administered a mild shock to a group of mice whenever they were given the scent of acetophenone, five times a day for three days. A week and a half later, he had those mice mate with females. Their offspring grew up with a high sensitivity to acetophenone, despite having no experience with the compound. The following generation was also unusually skittish around acetophenone. Dias also discovered that all three generations devoted a higher-than-average number of olfactory receptors to detecting the odor compared to mice in a control group.</p> <p>The mice were inheriting the fears of their ancestors. “Descendants bear the imprints of ancestral traumas,” he says.</p> <p>The study of alterations in gene expression caused by environmental factors and experience is called epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications switch specific genes on and off, often through methylation of the cytosine nucleotide. Even though the DNA sequences themselves don’t change, epigenetic changes can sometimes be passed down to offspring. The extent of this inheritance is debated: The University of Massachusetts molecular biologist Oliver Rando asked in a <i>Nature</i> article just last year “why hasn’t this been obvious to all the brilliant researchers in the past hundred years of genetics?”<sup>2</sup></p> <p>But epigenetic modifications may be passed on in a variety of ways. A study led by Frances Champagne in 2006 found that neglectful mothering in rats caused DNA methylation of estrogen receptors in female offspring.<sup>3</sup> When the neglected female rats grew up and had babies of their own, their decreased estrogen levels caused them to neglect their newborns, just as their mothers had. This was inheritance through behavior, rather than direct DNA-to-DNA transmission.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Even when a hero does appear to exert agency it is only to ultimately reveal his powerlessness.</p> </blockquote><p><span>Perhaps the most infamous historical example of epigenetics in humans comes from an episode at the end of World War II called the Dutch Hunger Winter. In the winter of 1944-45 Germany created a man-made famine in the Netherlands. The Dutch kept careful records of families and births during the Hunger Winter, and were able to track the effects of that period of starvation on pregnant women. “Researchers followed their descendants through time and what they see is that there are certain windows in pregnancy where if mom is starved, the baby is at higher risk later in life for obesity and Type 2 diabetes,” says Barry Starr, a geneticist at Stanford University. “It’s almost as if that [period of starvation] has caused a change in the genetic pattern to need more food.”</span><br/></p> <p>Epigenetic effects in humans also extend to behavior. A 2007 study found that Holocaust survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder passed down to their children a genetic predisposition for the disorder.<sup>4</sup> Other work by Rachel Yehuda, the director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Division at Mount Sinai Hospital, has shown that descendants of mothers who survived the Holocaust and 9/11 bear the imprints of ancestral traumas.</p> <p>It isn’t just trauma that gets passed down. Science has shown us that our parents’ characters <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/the-strange-persistence-of-first-languages" target="_blank">influence us deeply</a> even in the course of a normal childhood.</p> <p>Studies of twins beginning in the late 1970s found that genetic inheritance is responsible for up to 60 percent of the so-called big five personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness. And in the past three decades we’ve learned that roughly 50 percent of the variance in aggression and aggressive behavior is hereditary.<sup>5</sup> A 2009 meta-analysis by Sybil Alexandra Burt of 103 twin and adoption studies found a higher number, with about 65 percent heritability.<sup>6</sup> Frighteningly, like blue eyes or fair complexion, violence is highly heritable.</p> <p>Trauma and violence can also pass from parent to child without any genetic inheritance. John B. Watson was one of the earliest developmental psychologists to fall firmly in the behaviorism camp, which held that environmental and cultural influences shaped identity to a far greater extent than genes. In a bold declaration in his book <i>Behaviorism</i>, Watson argues that upbringing is paramount: “Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in, and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.”</p> <p>Watson might downplay the genetic inheritance of trauma. But, if his contention that the actions and opinions of the parent set the direction of the child, would the ultimate effect be very different?</p> <p>Watson’s audacious convictions informed psychologist Albert Bandura’s social learning theory. Working in the 1960s, Bandura posited that social behavior was in large part acquired through observation. In a series of now-famous experiments conducted in 1961 and 1963, Bandura put children in a playroom full of toys, with an adult model on the other side of the room. In one group, the adult model acted aggressively toward an inflatable Bobo doll, punching it, striking it with a mallet, and verbally abusing it. In the other group, the adult model played peacefully with the doll. When the children were then taken to a separate room and given the opportunity to play with their own Bobo doll, those who had been exposed to the violent model were more likely to be physically and verbally aggressive.</p> <p>Children who observed violent behavior in adult models were far more likely to exhibit violent behavior themselves, with follow-up experiments showing that such violent behavior often persisted for months.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>By nature or nurture, we humans grow and live in the shadows of our parents and our upbringing—especially when it comes to trauma and tragedy.</p>  <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Bob-breaker" data-title="Learned%20behavior" data-capper="In%20a%20famous%20set%20of%20experiments%2C%20Albert%20Bandura%20showed%20that%20children%20were%20more%20likely%20to%20act%20violently%20towards%20a%20doll%20after%20seeing%20someone%20else%20do%20the%20same." data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7672_7ec2442aa04c157590b2fa1a7d093a33.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><strong>Learned behavior:</strong> In a famous set of experiments, Albert Bandura showed that children were more likely to act violently towards a doll after seeing someone else do the same.</figcaption></figure> <p><br/></p><p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n the face of it, the principles of the Enlightenment are directly opposed to those of Greek tragedy. Jean-Jacques Rousseau said that “everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man.” Like other Enlightenment thinkers, he believed that mankind’s nature was pure and uncorrupted, and that it was society and other men who spoiled it. Across Europe in that “long 18th century,” philosophers like Voltaire, Thomas Paine, and Adam Smith championed reason and self-determination over what they believed to be the old-world vulgarities of religious orthodoxy, superstition, and holy wars. Theirs was an ideal of self-improvement, rationality, and diligently employed free will. Through the Enlightenment lens, mankind was freed of the past.</p> <p>The protagonists of the major Greek tragedies, on the other hand, are prisoners of fate, forced to play out hereditary curses and ancestral traumas. Their lives are anything but manifestations of free will and self-determination. And even when a hero does appear to exert agency—Sophocles’ Oedipus being the perfect example—it is only to ultimately reveal his powerlessness, or what Christopher Rocco calls “all the ambiguities and ironies of enlightenment itself.”<sup>8</sup> The further Oedipus stretches his power of will, the harder it snaps back to his preordained destiny. It is not that the Greek tragedians were strangers to free will and self-actualization. They just understood that the traits that would eventually be glorified by the Enlightenment could not be accepted unilaterally; other forces were always at work.</p> <p>In his 1999 essay “Ancestral Curses,” classical scholar Martin West decries other critics’ tendency to refer to the term inherited curse “when what they mean is inherited guilt, or some kind of genetic corruption, or persistent but unexplained adversity.” Ancestral curses, genetic corruption. The conflation is telling: Study both closely enough, and the line between them blurs. It’s the loaded connotations of the word “curse”—supernatural, occult, folkloric—that throw us off.</p> <p>If we understand a curse as nothing more or less than that double helix snaking through our chromosomes, or the hard lessons of behaviorism, then how much has our understanding of fate really changed in two and a half millennia?</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Mike Mariani is a writer and educator based in Hoboken, NJ.

            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n some sense, Lee Rogers Berger found himself and the drowning woman at the same time.</p> <p>The Georgia native had just returned home after dropping out of Vanderbilt University, where terrible grades in his pre-law major and straight As in his electives had convinced him that he was ill-suited to law but well-suited to something else. For the time being, that something else was covering local news as a photographer.</p> <p>One night, Berger was reporting from the banks of the Savannah River on a woman’s disappearance when he spotted something in his peripheral vision. He dropped his camera onto the ground, himself into the river, became <a href="http://www.profleeberger.com/atlantajournalconstitutionarticle.html" target="_blank">the hero of the day</a>, and discovered an uncanny talent: being in the right place at the right time.</p> <p>Decades later, he pulled a similar trick with his career. While earning his Ph.D. in paleoanthropology in 1994, he began site work in South Africa on the advice of Donald Johanson, a co-discoverer of the 3-million-year-old hominin fossil popularly known as <i>Lucy</i>. After a few notable finds around the so-called “Cradle of Humankind” territory northwest of Johannesburg, Berger saw his career slow to a “bits and pieces” crawl.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>On the very first day of exploring the site, they discovered 21 new cave sites.</p> </blockquote><p>One day in late 2007, sitting at home, fed up and worn down, Berger became the “last person on Earth” to discover Google Earth. Then something clicked. “I started plugging GPS coordinates in to look at the sites I’d seen in the ’90s, and I realized they were wrong,” he said. “The U.S. government had delivered error into my surveys. I’d wasted three years of my life. That was a terrible moment.”</p> <p>Berger returned to the field, but to a spot 1 kilometer away from the site where he’d been digging <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/lee-berger/" target="_blank">for the last 17 years</a>. On the very first day of exploring the site, he was on a walk with his son, Matthew, when the 9-year-old stumbled upon an unmistakably hominid clavicle. They discovered 21 new cave sites before the day was out. Within the week, Berger found 125 new cave sites and about 14 fossil sites. By July of 2008, he’d found over 700 new cave sites and discovered <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>, the find that cemented him as one of the most important paleoanthropologists alive.</p> <p>Luck struck again in late 2013, when Rick Hunter, a cave explorer-for-hire, showed Berger photographs depicting fossil-strewn chambers inside the Rising Star Cave, also part of the Cradle of Humankind site. The only problem? At one point, the cave constricted down to only 7.5 inches in width—which barred Berger from entering it. But Berger didn’t let his large size stop him. Instead, he put out a Facebook ad calling for “tiny and small specialised cavers and spelunkers” who were willing to work for nothing. Within a day he’d received around 60 applications from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/10/africa/homo-naledi-human-relative-species/" target="_blank">can-do, overeager, and skinny early-career explorers</a>, from which he selected six (he called them his “underground astronauts”).</p> <p>The result was the discovery of an extinct species called <i>Homo naledi</i>, which belong to the same genus as modern humans. Over 1,500 skeletal pieces were recovered, making it one of the largest ever finds of this kind.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="a%20tight%20fit" data-capper="The%20opening%20to%20the%20Rising%20Star%20Cave%20was%20far%20too%20small%20for%20Lee%20Berger%20to%20fit%20into.%20To%20plumb%20the%20cave%u2019s%20secrets%2C%20he%20had%20to%20enlist%20the%20help%20of%20smaller%20people%2C%20who%20could%20wiggle%20through%20the%207.5-inch%20wide%20opening." data-credits="%3Ci%3ENautilus%3C/i%3E"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7655_572201a4497b0b9f02d4f279b09ec30d.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>a tight fit:</strong> The opening to the Rising Star Cave was far too small for Lee Berger to fit into.

As Tim White, a University of California Berkeley anthropology professor, noted ominously in an interview with <i>The Guardian</i> last month, “Rushing things, in particular to <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/how-i-tried-to-transplant-the-musical-heart-of-apocalypse-now" target="_blank">suit film-makers</a>, is very dangerous.”</p> <p>Berger is no stranger to such criticism—in some sense, it comes with his field. “Paleoanthropologists are a bunch of silver back gorillas,” said Patricia Kramer, an anthropology professor at the University of Washington, in a <i>NOVA Next</i> piece. “The new brash group on the block is always going to be a lightning rod.”</p> <p>In 1995, Berger co-authored a paper on the lone fossil discovered at the Taung site in South Africa, hypothesizing that the fossil’s isolation and skeletal damage could be explained by its being attacked and dropped there by a predatory bird. Initially mocked, the “Taung bird of prey hypothesis” ended up becoming the most commonly accepted version of events.</p> <p>Berger will tell you with confidence and a booming laugh that his recipe is “fortitude or stupidity.” Whatever the case, his strategy has generated undeniable results.</p>  <p><br/></p> <p><b>How did you discover <i>Homo naledi</i>?</b></p> <p>Have you heard the joke about the priest who prays to God all the time? Well, there’s this priest who prays to God all the time. And he says, “Just let me win the lottery. Just let me win the lottery. Just let me win the lottery.” Well, months and months of this go by and this big voice says, “buy a lottery ticket.” [After <i>sediba</i>] I quit buying lottery tickets, I quit exploring. So that’s what led to me getting back into the field.</p> <p><b>Why is it an important find?</b></p> <p>We are looking at the largest assemblage [of hominid fossils] ever discovered. It looks different—its large brain, its apelike shoulders, humanlike arms, curved fingers, primitive pelvis, long legs, human foot—we’d seen bits of that in isolation, but we’d never seen them in one animal. What it tells us is that there are lineages we haven’t discovered, tons of lineages. It goes back to the meandering stream idea of evolution. We should stop trying to shoehorn these discoveries into one idea, or one line. It shows mosaicism, that things in evolution do not always happen in an ordinary linear fashion.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>I think we should all think very carefully about what it means to be a human.</p> </blockquote><p><b>How does it change paleoanthropology?</b><br/></p> <p>We had senior anthropologists saying there was nothing left to find, we should stop teaching graduate students, you’re not going to find fossils in the soil anymore, they’re a declining resource. The richest fossil hominin site on the continent of Africa was less than a mile from the most explored locality on the continent. What does that tell you? That there must be extraordinary findings still.</p> <p><b>What were the <i>naledi</i> like?</b></p> <p><i>Naledi</i> were an immensely complex species. The best hypothesis for how they got [into the caves they were discovered in] was they deliberately disposed of the bodies. We thought that was not only unique to humans, but uniquely defining as human. The concept around whatever deliberate body disposal was … you’re recognizing self-mortality, and the complex things that spin off of that. I think we should all think very carefully about what it means to be a human, and how we’ve differentiated ourselves from the natural world.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="Pucker%20Up" data-capper="Lee%20Berger%20kisses%20a%20replica%20of%20a%20%3Ci%3EHomo%20naledi%3C/i%3E%20skull%20during%20a%20ceremonial%20presentation%20of%20his%20discovery%20in%20Maropeng%2C%20South%20Africa.%20%3Ci%3EHomo%20naledi%3C/i%3E%20stood%20about%204%20feet%2010%20inches%20tall%2C%20and%20bore%20a%20mix%20of%20primitive%20and%20modern%20features%2C%20including%20a%20slender%20body%20and%20a%20brain%20roughly%20the%20size%20of%20an%20orange." data-credits="Stefan%20Heunis"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7661_2ec0274c1774841e6820ad9339b81dbf.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Pucker Up:</strong> Lee Berger kisses a replica of a <i>Homo naledi</i> skull during a ceremonial presentation of his discovery in Maropeng, South Africa. <i>Homo naledi</i> stood about 4 feet 10 inches tall, and bore a mix of primitive and modern features, including a slender body and a brain roughly the size of an orange.</span><span class="credit">Stefan Heunis</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Don’t other species bury their dead?</b><br/></p> <p>Be careful of rumors, they propagate. The most common one [is] elephant graveyards. That comes from stories that came out of early hunters in East Africa. They’d find these pilings of dead elephant bones. What’s happening is, elephants go to these grassy hills where they can eat, they die there, and they end up collected in muddy streams and their bones get preserved. Observational studies of animals show they may mourn, they may show [grief for] the death of an individual. The important thing is, they don’t all do it, and they don’t do it universally and in the same fashion over and over again and in every circumstance. Humans dispose of their bodies—all human societies do it, they do it universally and they do it whether the dead are related to them or not. That’s what <i>naledi</i> appear to be doing.</p><p><b>Could the bodies be in the caves for reasons other than burial?</b></p> <p>You would not believe the suggestions we get. [Like] “This is a sex dungeon.” We call that the <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> hypothesis. You get the alien abductions, the meteor colliding, running to the cave to hide. We did get the tsunami hypothesis [that a tsunami caused <i>Homo naledi </i>to hide in the cave]. You could refute that from the sediments. Plus if there had been a tsunami of that scale, you would not be coming into a tiny chamber that’s 120 feet underground. [There’s a] mass death hypothesis—that they got into there and died. [But] the roof didn’t collapse. [Then there’s the idea that] “maybe modern humans killed them and threw them in there.” Wait a minute—are you kidding? That story was written in something called <i>The Time Machine</i>, by Orson Welles. You would rather create some bizarre story that literally is fiction, of humans taking those small pet brain hominids and disposing of them one by one?</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>If humans don’t become more aware that they’re part of the natural world, this isn’t going to be pretty for any of us.</p> </blockquote><p><b>How do you explain the controversy around your research?</b><br/></p> <p>Some part of it is generational, that is, my generation of scientists is the computer generation. We’re also the Internet generation, [the generation] which invented the Internet and began applying it. I’ve been fortunate enough to be involved with some of the first major discoveries of that generation. Most of them have multiple authors; I’m just the sounding board. I try to tell people “this isn’t the Lee Berger show.” In sports there’s a term of, “they’re playing the man, not the ball,” and I think there’s a bit of that. I am the face, and therefore I get to be the windmill that they pick at, Don Quixote-like. But that’s okay, somebody has to take the fire for this. And there’s a lot of tension in this field. I think particularly people who haven’t grown up in the last 30 years of an extraordinary and explosive change in tech and communications will be very uncomfortable. The people involved in that are like, “Elvis Presley and rock ’n roll—that’s not the way we did it! Grr!”</p> <p><b>What do you say to those who say you work too quickly?</b></p> <p>I believe that if we engage more of the scientific community, we can get the job done faster and better. The way I did this [with the <i>naledi</i>] was going back to this site, and getting hundreds of people underground. I could never go into that 7.5-inch slot. I will never be in that cave. [Instead,] I brought 30-35 early career scientists along. That allowed us to produce these papers in 3 years. A lot of that was due to new technology, but also due to engaging these very current researchers who normally would never get access to these hominid fossils. It’s something I’ve been criticized for, but now am unapologetic for, bringing in these early career scientists. If we tried to do it the traditional way, we’d have to wait decades and decades. At the same time, when someone asks “why aren’t you jumping in to the <i>naledi</i> chamber,” blasting it open, I say those fossils have been there for a million years, and no one has the right to do that, and shouldn’t we be saving this for future generations of science? Because I can see within my lifetime how technology changes. The thing we did with the chamber now, we couldn’t do three years before.</p> <p><b>How was the communication of the <i>naledi </i>result unusual?</b></p> <p>We did open access so we could engage with the whole world. The views and downloads have been extraordinary. For a scientific paper, it’s outrageous and wonderful. Schoolchildren are thinking these things, not just in America, but around the world. You have first graders handling hominid info that was handed out in the last two weeks. Scientists are sharing it on twitter. [We are] replacing the Kardashians for 24 hours. You’re witnessing millions of people who didn’t know <i>Homo naledi</i> didn’t exist on September 10 [of this year]. And now a tenth of the world does.</p> <p><b>In what ways can society learn from this discovery?</b></p> <p>I would like these discoveries to make humans more introspective and much more aware we are a part of natural world with a past. And a deep one. That’s complex. And if humans don’t become more aware that they’re part of the natural world, this isn’t going to be a pretty world for any of us, plant or animal, if we continue to use this as our right, and our domain, and treat ourselves as if we’re different. We don’t have some special privilege.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Susie Neilson is an editorial intern at </i>Nautilus.</p>

Flórez that profiles people with the condition.</span><span class="credit">Guillermo F. Flórez</span></figcaption></figure>  <p><span class="dropcap mqw">W</span>hat would you do if you lost your inner monologue? You know, the one where you tell yourself “I don’t want to get up yet,” or “This is one delicious burger.” That’s what happened to Tinna Geula Phillips.</p>  <p>In 1997, Phillips suffered a massive stroke, which left her without the ability to communicate in any meaningful way. She went from being fluent in six different languages to virtually mute. “I cried inside, because I cannot communicate. My mom, others, Chinese! I don’t know. Is not communicate, nothing. I, six languages, gone!”</p>  <p>Phillips has aphasia, from the Ancient Greek “without speech.” Typically, aphasia occurs after a stroke, which causes the brain to go “into a form of shock” according to aphasia specialist Robert Volin, who runs an aphasia speech therapy clinic at New York Medical College. First, reduced blood flow or bleeding causes brain cells to start dying off. Then a cascade of neural transmitters signal the brain’s neurons to keep firing, even as they slowly starve from a lack of oxygen. Any brain cells killed during this time, says Volin, “can’t come back. [They’re] just gone.”</p>  <p>Between 25 and 40 percent of people who suffer a stroke will have aphasia. Damage tends to be in two brain areas: Broca’s area, in the posterior left prefrontal cortex, and Wernicke’s area, which is in the posterior left temporal cortex. In Brocha’s aphasia, people have problems with fluency, muddling the order of the words in a sentence, and disregarding grammar. Wernicke’s aphasia affects how much sense the speaker makes. Their language becomes confused, or even nonsense. It can also limit a person’s rhythm, impeding fluency and word formation.</p> <p>Phillips was diagnosed with global aphasia, which is the term used to describe a severe loss of the ability to communicate and comprehend language. For two years, she says, she was unsure whether she would ever recover the means to communicate, even in a limited sense. “One year, two year, nothing. Before, going to parties. Thirties, I learning English, English, English, going to parties gone. Now, 40s, I ask ‘Why 30s [gone by]?’ Very emotion. Is very hard.”</p>  <p><img data-title="" data-w="733" data-h="410" class="vimeo-breakers" src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505463117_640.jpg" data-video-id="118439796" data-capper="A%20clip%20from%20the%20documentary%20film%20%3Ci%3ESpeechless%3C/i%3E." data-credits="Guillermo%20F.%20Fl%26%23243%3Brez"/></p>  <p>But one of the most profound effects was losing the ability to speak with herself. Her inner monologue disappeared for several months, leaving her unable to process her own thoughts in what is considered a psychologically “normal” way. The ability to converse with one’s self, known as “self-talk,” or “inner speech,” is essential for conceptualizing our emotions, processing our memories, and for predicting the future. It is inherently associated with our sense of self.</p>  <p>The relationship between language and the self is made clear in child development. As infants gain the ability to understand and use language, they also become more aware of themselves and their place in their environment. When infants don’t develop their language as expected, it is often a sign of a larger issue, such as autism spectrum disorder, which is also associated with a lack of self-awareness and sociability.</p>  <p>Phillips is keenly aware of this connection, both as an aphasia sufferer, and as a parent: She has twin sons. “Ethan, Joshua, 1 year 10 months not talk. Many people have children 1 year 5 months talk, is very frustrating. My nanny is Moroccan, me is very hard, my husband is going to consulting and gone to 7.15 at night then one hour [they] go to sleep. I Tuesday Thursday going to toddlers, teachers told me is ok, is very good. Ethan, Joshua very good, communicate, talk.”</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="31_Tinna-therapy-BREAKER" data-title="" data-capper="Twin%20babies%20Ethan%20and%20Joshua%20Phillips%20are%20a%20testament%20to%20Phillips%u2019%20recouped%20identity%20after%20her%20diagnosis%20with%20aphasia%2C%20which%20she%20once%20thought%20would%20leave%20her%20unable%20to%20communicate%20for%20life." data-credits="Guillermo%20F.%20Fl%26%23243%3Brez"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/5906_6d96718a701f5bfba283bbdc71dfa5c4.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Recovery:</strong>Twin babies Ethan and Joshua Phillips are a testament to Phillips’ recouped identity after her diagnosis with aphasia, which she once thought would leave her unable to communicate for life.</span><span class="credit">Guillermo F. Flórez</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Phillips is just one of three people with aphasia that documentary filmmaker Guillermo F. Flórez has profiled in a new film about the condition, <i>Speechless</i>. In it, Phillips describes her internal silence as a total loss of identity. Some research has even suggested that internal speech is necessary for higher consciousness. But American philosopher Jerry Fodor proposes an alternative idea, called the “Language of Thought” hypothesis. He argues that in addition to our consciously perceived internal monologues, we have a second internal language that is codified into the brain—a kind of “mentalese,” that we don’t consciously perceive.</p>  <p>Fodor uses the analogy of a computer: There is the set of operations that occur when a particular binary sequence is executed, and there are coding languages that can be used to make those binary sequences. The brain, he argues, works in the same way: There is a base language that is tied to cognition and thought, and then there are other, developed languages that are used to express these thoughts. In this view, higher consciousness can survive even without an internal monologue.</p>  <p>Phillips’ husband, Jeff, points out that no one else will ever appreciate how Phillips felt during that time. Other aphasia sufferers may describe their experience very differently, and have had very different outcomes. What is clear is that some degree of recovery is possible. Volin says that people such as Phillips really prove the fact that the adult brain has a far higher degree of neural plasticity than previously thought. Contrary to many expectations, Phillips’ life didn’t stop progressing after her stroke—she met her husband years after through online dating (her sister helped set her profile up). Another impossible dream, having children, has also since been fulfilled. Now, she feels defined by motherhood and family, not by her condition—an emotion Flórez manages to capture on screen. As wrapped up in personal identity as language is, for many, it doesn’t define the self.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>To find out more about </i>Speechless<i> and Flórez’s work, please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speechlessdoc.com/">speechlessdoc.com.</a></i></p> <p><br/></p>  <p><i>Claire Cameron is </i>Nautilus’ <i>social media &amp; news editor.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><i>This article originally appeared on our blog, <a href="http://nautil.us/blog" target="_blank">Facts So Romantic</a>, in April 2015.</i><br/></i></p>

            <p>“Even in principle, one cannot demand an alibi of an electron!”<br/>Hermann Weyl, <i>The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics</i> (1950)</p><p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave you ever heard the story of Martin Guerre?</p> <p>He lived with his bride and newborn son in Artigat, a small village in the Pyrenees foothills of Southwestern France. In 1548, at the age of 24, after being accused by his own parents of theft, Martin Guerre disappeared, leaving his family behind. Eight years later, after his parents had passed away, Guerre returned home, reuniting with his wife, son, and fellow villagers.</p> <p>Over the next three years, Guerre and his wife, Bertrande, had two more children. All was going swimmingly until a foreign soldier came through town and claimed that the man who had returned was not the real Martin Guerre, but an imposter named Arnault du Tilh. The accuser claimed to have fought alongside Guerre in the Spanish army, and said that Guerre had lost a leg in battle. Bertrande ignored the accusation, certain that the man with whom she was living was, and had always been, her husband. But soon Guerre’s uncle and Bertrande’s stepfather joined the foreign soldier in accusing the man of forging Guerre’s identity, and took him to trial.</p> <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>If electrons were distinguishable, all would be chaos.</p> </blockquote><p><span>It is a story that has persisted in our collective imagination—having been made into a movie, a musical, a historical novel, a TV series, and a </span><i>Simpsons</i><span> episode—because it strikes an ever-raw nerve: There is a sense in which our notions of identity are insecure. How can we be sure who someone is, even someone close? How can we be sure who we are, or <i>that</i> we are? What can identity mean in a world that is constantly changing?</span><br/></p> <p>The early vitalist philosophers had a ready answer: Each of us is distinguished by a divine soul, our physical bodies mere puppets animated by our invisible selves. But science has eroded this answer, and sought identity in the physical body itself: At a microscopic level, promises the reductionist dream, there must be something to distinguish each one of us from another. A hard-nosed foundation for our identity, one made of molecules and atoms.</p> <p>That path, however, is far shakier than it might seem. Cast your gaze on Guerre, standing there in the courtroom. Zoom in. Look closer at his face, his skin, his pores. Burrow down to his most basic constituents. There: See that electron? It’s a building block of Guerre himself. But what if we were to put the electron on trial instead of Guerre?</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gefter_BR_Guerre" data-title="True love?" data-capper="Gerard Depardieu and Nathalie Baye in the 1982 movie adaptation of the 16th-century tale of Martin Guerre and his wife, Bertrande.

Yes, we can all expect some cringe-worthy puns. Let’s get them out of the way now, shall we? The air in the room is <i>electric</i>. The defendant is <i>charged</i> with the serious crime of identity fraud. Good. Let’s move on.</p> <p>The judge raps his gavel to call the courtroom to order. Twelve jurors sit at attention. The defendant squirms in its seat, to the chagrin of its attorneys and the frustration of the sketch artist.</p> <p>An electron—<i>any</i> electron—is an elementary particle, which is to say it has no known substructure. Guerre was made of molecules, molecules are made of atoms, atoms are made of elementary particles, but elementary particles are the end of the line. They are made of nothing, being, as they are, the most basic building blocks of the material world. An electron is a point, taking up quite literally no space at all. Every electron is defined solely in terms of its mass (tiny), its spin (1/2) and its charge (negative). Those three features comprise <i>in toto</i> the complete and comprehensive identity of the electron, as its want for spatial extent bears no room to house any further attributes.</p> <p>What does this mean? That every electron is the precise spitting image of every other electron, lacking, as it does, even the slightest leeway for even the most minuscule deviation. Unlike a composite, macroscopic object like Guerre—or anything else in our everyday experience—electrons are not merely similar, if uncannily so, but deeply, profoundly <i>identical</i>—interchangeable, fungible, mere placeholders, empty labels that read “electron” and nothing more.</p> <p>This has some rather curious—and measurable—consequences. Consider the following example: We have two elementary particles, A and B, and two boxes, and we know each particle must be in one of the two boxes at any given time. Assuming that A and B are similar but distinct, the setup allows four possibilities: A is in Box 1 and B is in Box 2, A and B are both in Box 1, A and B are both in Box 2, or A is in Box 2 and B is in Box 1. The rules of probability tell us that there is a 1-in-4 chance of finding the two particles in each of these configurations.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, particles A and B are truly <i>identical</i>, we must make a rather strange adjustment in our thinking, for in that case there is literally no difference between saying that A is in Box 1 and B in Box 2, or B is in Box 1 and A is in Box 2. Those scenarios, originally considered two distinct possibilities, are in fact precisely the same. In total, now, there are only three possible configurations, and probability assigns a 1-in-3 chance that we will discover the particles in any one of them.</p> <p>Experiment confirms that the microworld obeys the 1-in-3 statistics. Swap out the accused with another of its kind—the universe would register no difference, and neither would we.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>core one for the defense. To drive the point home, the defense attorney calls to the stand one Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for expert testimony. To establish his status as an expert, counsel recites Wilczek’s credentials into the record: countless books and scientific papers published, a protracted list of awards won. “Oh,” the attorney smiles, “and a Nobel Prize.” The prosecutor looks begrudgingly impressed.</p> <p>“Dr. Wilczek,” the defense attorney begins. “You have stated what you believe to be the single most profound result of quantum field theory. Can you repeat for the court what that is?”</p> <p>The physicist leans in toward the microphone. “That two electrons are indistinguishable,” he says.</p> <p>The smoking gun for indistinguishability, and a direct result of the 1-in-3 statistics, is interference. Interference betrays the secret life of the electron, explains Wilczek. On observation, we will invariably find the electron to be a corpuscular particle, but when we are <i>not</i> looking at it, the electron bears the properties of a wave. When two waves overlap, they interfere—adding and amplifying in the places where their phases align—peaks with peaks, troughs with troughs—and canceling and obliterating where they find themselves out of sync. These interfering waves are not physical waves undulating through a material medium, but mathematical waves called wavefunctions. Where physical waves carry energy in their amplitudes, wavefunctions carry probability. So although we never observe these waves directly, the result of their interference is easily seen in how it affects probability and the statistical outcomes of experiment. All we need to do is count.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>One can’t help but wonder whether it is the electrons who are so devious or rather space itself.</p> </blockquote><p><span>The crucial point is that only truly identical, indistinguishable things interfere. The moment we find a way to distinguish between them—be they particles, paths, or processes—the interference vanishes, and the hidden wave suddenly appears in its particle guise. If two particles show interference, we can know with absolute certainty that they are identical. Sure enough, experiment after experiment has proven it beyond a doubt: electrons interfere. Identical they are—not for stupidity or poor eyesight but because they are deeply, profoundly, inherently indistinguishable, every last one.</span><br/></p> <p>This is no minor technicality. It is the core difference between the bizarre world of the quantum and the ordinary world of our experience. The indistinguishability of the electron is “what makes chemistry possible,” says Wilczek. “It’s what allows for the reproducible behavior of matter.” If electrons were distinguishable, varying continuously by minute differences, all would be chaos. It is their discrete, definite, digital nature that renders them error-tolerant in an erroneous world.</p> <p>Their identicalness means that while we can speak of electrons generally, we are barred from making any statements about any particular electron. “If you have two electrons and later observe two electrons, but you didn’t watch them at intermediate stages, you cannot say which was originally which,” says Wilczek. “It’s not just that you are confused—it is impossible in principle to tell which was which.”</p> <p>Peter Pesic, a physicist, historian, and musician at St. John’s College in Santa Fe, New Mexico, puts it this way: “We could make a statement like, ‘There are five electrons.’ We can give them a cardinal number. But we couldn’t give them ordinal numbers.” Cardinal numbers are counting numbers. <i>Five</i> electrons. Ordinal numbers are ordering numbers—the <i>first</i>, the <i>second</i>, the <i>third</i>, the <i>fourth</i>, the <i>fifth</i>. To say that we can have cardinals without ordinals is to say that we can attach labels to the group but not to any of its individual members—which is itself to say that its members are not individuals at all. “That’s very surprising,” Pesic continued, “because we think of cardinal and ordinal numbers as if they always both apply. At the microscopic level, that’s not true. You have one without the other.”</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gefter_BR" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7679_333943ff8a14617d66ea94ec176fc787.jpg" alt=""/></figure><p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he prosecutor paces slowly back and forth in front of the witness stand, considering his cross-examination. Perhaps, he suggests, we can distinguish electrons not by their inherent features, but by their location in space. Even if two electrons are in every way identical, surely we can tell them apart by the mere fact that one is <i>here</i> and the other <i>there</i>, can we not?</p> <p>Wilczek’s reply is a simple “no.” While corpuscular particles appear to occupy specific points in space, waves, by their very nature, do not. And so when particles like our electron go unwatched, they become diffuse and placeless. Their wavefunctions, though concentrated in particular regions of space, stretch out to infinity, so that there is always a small but non-zero chance that their particulate nature should manifest itself anywhere, should someone decide to go looking for it.</p> <p>When no one is looking, the electron isn’t <i>anywhere</i>, but merely has the probability to be found in various locations—a fact so strange that one can’t help but wonder whether it is the electrons who are so devious or rather space itself. What happens to space when we’re not looking? Does it simply fall away?</p> <p>Wilczek puts it this way: “Another aspect of quantum mechanics closely related to indistinguishability, and a competitor for its deepest aspect, is that if you want to describe the state of two electrons, it’s not that you have a wavefunction for one and a separate wavefunction for the other, each living in three-dimensional space. You really have a <i>six</i>-dimensional wavefunction that has two positions in it where you can fill in two electrons.” The six-dimensional wavefunction means that the probabilities for finding each electron at a particular location are not independent—that is, they are entangled.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The identicalness of electrons not only cripples the concept of a thing, but also the concept of space.</p> </blockquote><p><span>In the old way of looking at things, we had space and then we put things in it. In the quantum view, we have things—like electrons—and space emerges as a way to describe the complex set of relations and interdependencies among them, with localized points like “here” and “there” peeking through like the tips of icebergs.</span><br/></p> <p>When two particles are entangled, their properties—their <i>identities</i>—reside in neither particle individually but in the relationship between them, a relationship that flaunts the usual constraints of space, bypassing it with what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” “We’ve got this problem that particles of matter are often entangled so,” says philosopher James Ladyman of the University of Bristol. “The state of the world can’t be written as the state of all the particles separately. They’re all tied together.”</p> <p>The identicalness of electrons—of all particles—not only cripples the concept of a thing, but also the concept of space, revealing them to be opposite sides of the same feeble coin. It is a clue that there is something wrong with the way that we cut the world into parts. A clue to a kind of holism, an underlying oneness.</p> <p>One what?</p> <p>Some, like Wilczek, say one field. It is no mystery that all electrons look alike, he says, because they are all manifestations, temporary excitations of one and the same underlying electron field, which permeates all space, all time. Others, like physicist John Archibald Wheeler, say one particle. He suggested that perhaps electrons are indistinguishable because there’s only one, but it traces such convoluted paths through space and time that at any given moment it appears to be many. Gottfried Leibniz, the 17th-century philosopher, put forth the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, which said if you can’t tell two things apart, they are not two things. On one hand, electrons appear to refute the principle. On the other, perhaps the multiplicity of particles—or the multiplicity of the <i>world</i>—is a kind of funhouse illusion.</p> <p>Time, it has been said, is what keeps everything from happening at once. In the same vein, space is what keeps everything from being one—or in Wheeler’s words, “what prevents everything from happening to me.” But in the realm of the quantum, the scaffolding provided by space recedes, and with it all notions of identity and thingness, and with them, the plurality of existence. The electron is everywhere, the electron is nowhere. A fugitive without a form. An outlaw <i>sans</i> alibi.</p> <p>And, clearly, innocent of identity fraud—by definition. But what about the human being that it builds?</p> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">Z</span>oom out.</p> <p>Bertrande, Guerre’s wife, had always refused to believe that her husband was a fraud. But during his trial she changed her mind, deciding that although the man claiming to be Martin Guerre knew many intimate details of their early relationship, he was not the man she’d married. And yet, when the disputed Guerre turned to her and wagered that if she were to swear that he wasn’t her betrothed, he would happily agree to his own execution Bertrande remained silent. Martin Guerre, now judged to be Arnault du Tilh, was convicted and sentenced to death by beheading.</p> <p>The doomed man appealed his case in Toulouse, insisting that he was in fact the true Martin Guerre. He made such a compelling case that the judges of the appellate court were ready to acquit him when, to everyone’s amazement, a man appeared in the courthouse claiming to be the real Martin Guerre. He looked very much like the accused, except that he walked with a wooden leg. Although this Martin Guerre was unable to recall many convincing private details about his earlier marriage, Guerre’s family and townsfolk were immediately convinced: <i>This</i> was Martin Guerre. The man who stood trial was hauled off for beheading while Bertrande begged her husband for forgiveness.</p> <p>In its decision, the court decided that du Tilh was not Martin Guerre. But what does it mean to be Martin Guerre? It is an act of persistence. It is to connect by some smooth and seamless trajectory to the Martin Guerre of every other moment in space and time, following what Einstein called a worldline with perfect fidelity and without deviation.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gefter_BR_World_line" data-title="Worldlines" data-capper="Physicists think of well-defined objects moving through space and time as describing lines and surfaces on charts like this one. But electrons don't leave well-defined worldlines." data-credits="Wikipedia"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7652_341cd40532980c4909c8c647f2138c03.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Worldlines:</strong> Physicists think of well-defined objects moving through space and time as describing lines and surfaces on charts like this one.

Guerre consists of fundamental particles, but their wordlines are not lines at all, just a series of points separated by strange and sundered lacunae. The elecron’s worldline is, in the words of Wheeler, a great smoky dragon with a well-defined head, a distinct tail and nothing but vapor in between. “What we call reality,” Wheeler said, “consists of a few iron posts of observation between which we fill in by an elaborate papier mache construction of imagination and theory.”</p> <p>We want to believe that a thing is somehow more than the sum of its parts. That if we removed an electron’s charge, its mass, its spin, there would be something leftover, a bald electron, a <i>haecceity</i>, as the philosophers say, a primitive thisness. We want to believe that there is something that it means to be <i>this</i> electron rather than <i>that</i>, even if no observation, experiment, or statistic could ever reveal it. We want to believe in a primitive thisness because we want to believe in a primitive <i>our</i>ness—that should we one day meet our double, a perfect clone down to every detail, every dream, utterly indistinguishable to even the most discerning observer, that still there would be, here on the inside, something that it feels like to be us and not our double, a difference invisible and ineffable but true. That had there been no difference at all between the two Martin Guerres, one would still smile to himself in the secret knowledge that <i>he</i> was the real one.</p> <p>We want to believe it, but quantum mechanics doesn’t let us. “We are fooled into thinking that our distinguishability inheres in our material substance, but that’s just a big misunderstanding on our part,” says Pesic. What becomes of the electron’s haecceity when it interferes with another’s, its primitive thisness muddled with thatness? Epistemology dictates ontology. And so it seems ever more likely that haecceity is a kind of philosopher’s rendition of the soul, a comfort, an illusion. In mythology, in religion, we seek oneness. Just not so much of it that we disappear.</p> <p>So if the elementary particles of which we are made don’t really exist as objects, how do <i>we</i> exist?</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>“I think in the end,” says Ladyman, “it may well be that the world isn’t made of anything.”</p> </blockquote><p><span>“When you have more and more electrons, the state that they together form starts to be more and more capable of being distinct,” Pesic said. “So the reason that you and I have some kind of identity is that we’re composed of so enormously many of these indistinguishable components. It’s our </span><i>state</i><span> that’s distinguishable, not our materiality.”</span><br/></p> <p>“That’s a weird and beautiful idea,” Pesic continues. “Not one of our components—no electron, no proton—has any kind of stamp on it. But together they exist in a state that becomes sufficiently complex that it can then be distinguished from the state of every other person who’s composed of the same indistinguishable electrons and protons.”</p> <p>“My <i>thingness</i> is in how I’m organized, not what I’m made of,” says Ladyman. “But of course we know that anyway, because we know that the cells in our bodies are getting replaced all the time. Functional organization of structure, not the matter it’s made of, is what counts.”</p> <p>Yes we know this, that we are entities in physical flux, our bodies ships of Theseus, passing like paradoxes in the night. And yet we tend to believe that if we take a snapshot of ourselves at any given moment we will find that we are made of something—something that will pass, something that will change, but <i>something</i>.</p> <p>But the jury declares: No. There is no there there.</p> <p>Our identity is a state, but if it’s not a state of matter—not a state of individual physical objects, like quarks and electrons—then a state <i>of what</i>?</p> <p>A state, perhaps, of information. Ladyman suggests that we can replace the notion of a “thing” with a “real pattern”—a concept first articulated by the philosopher Daniel Dennett and further developed by Ladyman and philosopher Don Ross. “Another way of articulating what you mean by an object is to talk about compression of information,” Ladyman says. “So you can claim that something’s real if there’s a reduction in the information-theoretic complexity of tracking the world if you include it in your description.”</p> <p>Consider a cat. In computational terms, we can represent a cat using a bit map, a verbatim description down to the finest grain. Alternatively, we can render the cat in a coarser grain by ignoring its microscopic details and calling it simply “cat.” In the first case, we’d have to use many bits and great computational resources to describe how each bit individually changes its position over time. In the second, it takes barely a breath to achieve the same feat with the statement, “The cat walked across the room.” A cat, then, is a real pattern—a genuine ontological article of a mind-independent universe—because it’s computationally efficient.</p> <p>Now consider a non-genuine object. “Don Ross gave this example of his left earlobe, the largest elephant in Namibia and Miles Davis’ last solo,” Ladyman says. “Imagine a composite object of those three things. You don’t get any reduction in the computational complexity of tracking the world by qualifying over those three things because they don’t form a real pattern. That collection doesn’t figure in any projectable generalizations. The parts of you do. You’re a real pattern, over and above all your individual body parts, because we can just talk about you and you drag all your bits around with you.”</p> <p>Should such examples give the impression that the real patterns are patterns of particles, beware: Particles, like our electron, are real patterns themselves. “We’re using a particle-like description to keep track of the real patterns,” Ladyman says. “It’s real patterns all the way down.”</p> <p>We are nothing but fleeting patterns, signals in the noise. Drill down and the appearance of materiality gives way; underneath it, nothing. “I think in the end,” says Ladyman, “it may well be that the world isn’t made of anything.”</p> <p>Even so, we can point to patterns, and assign names. The more complex the pattern, the more we have to potentially gain by compressing its microscopic description, and the greater the case for identity. Consider a brain—with as many neurons as stars in the galaxy linked together through trillions of connections it’s the most complex object in the known universe. Try to compress it. Call it by just two words. Call it Martin Guerre. Push further. A single word, a single letter.</p> <p>Call it “I.”</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Amanda Gefter is a physics writer and author of </i>Trespassing on Einstein’s Lawn: A father, a daughter, the meaning of nothing and the beginning of everything. <i>She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</i></p><p><br/></p> <p><b>Additional Reading</b></p> <p>Ladyman, J. &amp; Ross, D. <i>Every Thing Must Go: Metaphysics Naturalized </i>Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K. (2007).<br/></p><p>Pesic, P. <i>Seeing Double: Shared Identities in Physics, Philosophy and Literature </i>MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (2002).</p> <p>Wilczek, F. &amp; Devine, B. <i>Longing for the Harmonies: Themes and Variations from Modern Physics</i> W.W.

We like to call things as we see them. For example, if it’s red and it’s huge: “Red Giant.” White and small: “White Dwarf.” Massive explosion: “Big Bang.” Dark and sucks everything in: “Black Hole.” Most of the time, classifying objects this way works fine—either it’s new, or it’s something we already know of. But sometimes, as with Pluto, we make new observations that force us to question the name, reassess the object, and identify it differently. You might think this never happens with something as clearly defined as a black hole, but you’d be wrong.</p> <p>Though we can’t observe them directly, we <i>can</i> see how the two types of black holes—stellar mass and supermassive—affect their surroundings. Stellar mass black holes, the product of a dying star going supernova and collapsing on itself, are the more familiar, predicted nearly a century ago by Einstein’s theory of general relativity; They usually only affect the behavior of the nearest star or two. Supermassive black holes, on the other hand, are over a million times more massive. We still don’t know how these form, but we believe they exist at the center of almost every galaxy, sometimes having the power to alter the appearance of their entire galaxy.</p> <p>This capacity for mass distortion makes characterizing supermassive black holes particularly tricky.</p> <p>As the stars, gas, and dust in the center of a galaxy get closer and closer to a supermassive black hole, they get packed tighter and tighter into a smaller and smaller space, heating up until, at a critical distance, everything is ripped apart, reduced to atomic particles. When we spot supermassive black holes, it’s this heat radiating away from the orbiting debris—known as an accretion disk—that we actually see, not the black hole itself. Some supermassive black holes “eat” more than others and, in the process, give off significantly more light than their less active brethren. These “active galactic nuclei,” or AGN for short, are some of the most powerful, most energetic forces in the Universe. Not only do they give off heat, they also often eject material in the form of collimated (beamed) jets, perpendicular to the plane of the disk, which blast their way out of the galaxy’s core—dwarfing in size not just the accretion disk, but also the galaxy itself. What’s more, some AGN have a dusty torus, the geometric equivalent of a donut, in the same plane as their accretion disk, but much, much bigger and thicker. So thick, in fact, that if you looked at them from the side, you wouldn’t see the disk at all, much less the black hole in the center (as seen in the image above). </p> <p>Despite having this standard model of an AGN—a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk with jets streaming out in opposite directions, all encompassed by a dusty torus—making sense of our observations is still a challenge: The light we see doesn’t always paint the same picture. Sometimes we see jets, sometimes we don’t. Sometimes we see the torus, sometimes we don’t. Sometimes we see light so concentrated and bright that we can’t even tell if there’s a galaxy there at all. We label these sightings accordingly: AGN at great distances with cores so bright, they outshine all their stars in optical light, are called quasars (for “quasi-stellar”), like the one pictured above; AGN that glow strongly in the infrared are called Seyferts, after the astronomer Carl Seyfert, who first identified them in 1943; And AGN, with cores and jets whose emitted light dominates in the radio spectrum, are called radio galaxies. </p> <p>If they are all fueled by supermassive black holes, why don’t all AGN look the same? One reason could be our point of view. The theory of AGN unification posits that all AGN have the same basic building blocks (accretion disk, jets, torus); The striking differences we observe, according to this theory, are all due to their orientation in space. </p> <p>Here on Earth, we only have one vantage point from which to observe the cosmos. We see galaxies randomly distributed around us, some of them edge-on, some of them face-on, and the rest at all the angles in-between. We cannot fly around to look at these galaxies from any other angle than the one they present to us. But with the advent of supercomputers, we can now simulate these galaxies better than ever before and virtually fly around them as much as we like, enjoying the sights from any angle. We can take an AGN and turn it so we’re looking straight down one of the jets, towards the galactic core, making it resemble a blazar, sort of a blazing quasar. Start tilting the AGN until the jet is rotated ninety degrees away from us, and it appears to morph from a blazar to a quasar to, finally, a Seyfert. </p> <p>Yet AGN unification is far from a settled problem in astrophysics. There could be other factors at play than just our point of view, like physical processes in and around black holes we don’t fully understand or measurements we haven’t thought to take. As we build better telescopes and amass new data, we can only hope that we’ll see these active galactic nuclei for what they really are. Otherwise, we might need a lot more names. </p><p><br/></p> <p><i>Summer Ash is the Director of Outreach for Columbia University’s Department of Astronomy.

            <p><span class="dropcap">I </span>have two children, and they are a study in contrasts: My son works at a gym designing and building rock-climbing walls; In his spare time, he climbs them. My daughter is a Ph.D. student in immunology; In her spare time, she writes novels. My son is the sort of person you want around in a crisis, cool-headed and springing to action. Let’s just say my daughter is not. My son spends money as soon as he earns it. My daughter manages to sock money away into a retirement fund, even on a student income. My son shrugs off unexpected misfortunes, declaring that there’s “no point” in brooding over them. My daughter can worry herself to exhaustion over misfortunes that will never happen. Though both were classified as “gifted,” my son was bored and alienated at school, while my daughter flourished.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits="Alley Dezmen/Getty Images"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7620_df27d2e23bf500eb010b2bc1a59b56d1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Alley Dezmen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve puzzled over their differences throughout their lives—how can two siblings contrast so completely along so many traits? It turns out that many of the personality divergences between my two children may boil down to the fact that, while my son’s mental life is closely connected to the outside world, my daughter spends much of her life inside her own head.</p><p><br/></p><p><span><span class="dropcap">A</span> </span><span>2010 </span><a href="http://ggsc-web02.ist.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/KILLINGSWORTH-WanderingMind.pdf" target="_blank">study</a><span> showed that people spent almost half their time thinking about something </span><i>other</i><span> than what they were doing. Generally, when your mind becomes detached from its immediate surroundings, the areas of the brain that process sensory information become less active, while activity ramps up in what’s known as the default mode network—interconnected brain regions that are active when people reflect on past memories or future plans, imagine the mental states of others, or think about “nothing in particular.”</span></p> <p>The question is, is that good for you?</p> <p>On the positive side, mind-wandering promotes planning for the future, allowing my daughter to lay the groundwork for financial security and a career with a long endgame. And it may be an essential ingredient in creativity. Several studies have <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015331" target="_blank">shown</a> that creativity blossoms under the same conditions that encourage mind-wandering—for example, an incubation period in which the mind is only lightly focused on an easy task is especially conducive to flashes of insight and imaginative solutions to problems. </p> <p>On the negative side is the tendency to lose focus on the task at hand and make distracted mistakes—the thought of my daughter driving is never a comforting one. Less obvious, and even darker, is a possible connection to neuroticism, a personality style that comes with hair-trigger anxiety, obsessive negative thoughts that endlessly chase their own tails, and a heightened risk for depression.</p> <p>One view has it that neuroticism is an amplified reaction to threat. This hypothesis receives support from <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915001949" target="_blank">evidence</a> that showing neurotic subjects images of fearful faces triggers an exaggerated response in the amygdala, a brain region that has been linked to fearful emotion. But in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661315001540" target="_blank">a recent paper</a>, Adam Perkins, a clinical psychologist at King’s College London, and his colleagues, argue that the engine of neuroticism is inward thought. As Perkins and his colleagues point out, neurotic people often feel anxious even when there’s no threat at all in the immediate environment. The anxiety is not attached to the here and now, in other words, but is a product of self-generated thought.</p> <p>This theory is supported by a number of parallels between mind-wandering and neuroticism: Both are associated with creativity and with planning ahead for the future. Both are linked to activity in the default mode network of the brain. And there’s evidence that rumination itself may be a mood depressant. In a paper pessimistically titled <a href="http://ggsc-web02.ist.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/KILLINGSWORTH-WanderingMind.pdf" target="_blank">“A wandering mind is an unhappy mind,”</a> Harvard psychologists Matthew Killingsworth and Daniel Gilbert reported that people felt less happy when their minds strayed from the task at hand, even when they were dwelling on pleasant topics—and even when the task itself was not enjoyable.</p><p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he connection between inner thought and neuroticism feeds the myth of the suffering creative genius. As the Danish philosopher and lifelong depressive Søren Kierkegaard put it, a poet is “an unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.” </p> <p>But it would be wrong to conclude that all mind-wanderers must pay for their creative spark with a lifetime of fretful, brooding misery. A <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00583/abstract" target="_blank">follow-up</a> to the study by Killingsworth and Gilbert showed that mind-wandering was a mood-enhancer in at least one specific context: when the ruminators judged their own thoughts to be <i>interesting</i>. Another <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077554" target="_blank">study</a> found that thoughts related to the future and the self are followed by periods of markedly improved mood, even if the thoughts themselves were negative. This may explain why, although my son wallowed in gloomy boredom at school, my daughter thrived—she could always retreat to a rich world of inner thought more riveting than what was happening in the classroom. </p> <p>One of my own friends, a successful poet, relentless ruminator, and one of the happiest people I’ve ever met, stands as an argument against Kierkegaard. He holds a day job as a lab technician doing routine, repetitive work that many would find dull, but that provides him with long incubation periods for his poetry, which he views as his real work. His example suggests that the path to happiness may not require turning down the rumination dial after all.</p><p><br/></p> <p><i>Julie Sedivy has taught linguistics and psychology at Brown University and the University of Calgary.

            <p><span class="dropcap mqw">W</span>hen Arne Hendriks, a 6” 4’ Dutchman, faced audience members at TEDxBrainport in 2012, he smiled apologetically. “I have some bad news for you,” he said. “You’re not short enough.” Hendriks believes that the planet’s growing population—currently at 7 billion—is unsustainable. His solution? We should shrink ourselves to 50 cm, around the height of a chicken. “I think we can actually achieve that,” he says. </p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits="Scott MacBride/Getty Images"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7614_b8b6674d4052e35e4553ac6788eb30b5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Scott MacBride/Getty Images</figcaption></figure> <p>Hendriks, an exhibition maker and historian, chose the 50 cm figure for several reasons: It’s rounded down from the shortest adult ever recorded, the 57-cm tall Gul Mohammed from New Delhi; it’s the average height of a newborn baby, a stature that’s “not hard to imagine”; and at 50 cm, humans would consume 2 percent of the food and fuel we do now, according to Hendriks’ calculations, instantly ending most of the problems of overpopulation, from CO2 pollution, to water shortages, to skyrocketing rent. </p> <p>Hendriks’ idea doesn’t seem too realistic, but its appeal is clear enough: With a tweak to our biology, miniature humans of the future could indulge our consumerist ways unfettered, freed from environmental concerns about habitat and resource depletion—at least to a point. (If our population reaches 350 billion, 50 times its current amount, that will bring us back to 100 percent of current consumption.) </p> <p>But is our height in fact arbitrary and flexible?</p> <p>For the last 2 million years, the height of mammals belonging to the genus <i>Homo </i>has risen gradually, with several sharp upticks. Around 500,000 BCE, as our ancestors evolved from tree climbers to ground walkers, body size increased dramatically, enabling us to cover more ground and forage plants and elude predators more effectively. </p> <p>But then, about 50,000 years ago, humans started to shrink, according to <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085407" target="_blank">Christopher Ruff</a>, a professor of functional anatomy at Johns Hopkins University. This is likely due to improvements in technology, like spears, he says, which diminished our need to outwrestle large cats. Our smaller and more nutrient-efficient (and therefore more famine-resistant) ancestors passed their genes onto subsequent generations. </p> <p>Over the last century, our species has seen an unprecedented species-wide growth spurt—a 4-inch increase on average. The most extreme examples are in Japan, where mean height has increased 5.5 inches in the last 50 years, and in the Netherlands, where people have grown eight inches in the last 150 years. This recent uptick differs from all other height fluctuations in history: It is due, not to natural selection, but to unnatural nutritional overabundance, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-we-getting-taller/" target="_blank">writes</a> Michael J. Dougherty, now director of education at the American Society of Human Genetics. </p> <p>Better nutrition brings about manifold improvements to physical functioning, like sharper eyesight, stronger bones, and lowered risk for Alzheimer’s and heart disease. But an increase in height, though correlated with these improvements, is not itself one of them. In fact, while it is thought of as a “a composite code for all the factors that make up a society’s well-being,” as the<i> New Yorker</i>’s Burkhard Bilger writes, height itself may diminish the benefits with which it’s correlated. </p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Being bigger is no longer better.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tall people have lower life expectancies, on average, than short people: They’re at increased risk for Alzheimer’s, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer—the latter because higher levels of growth hormone increases cell division rates and thus the likelihood for genetic mistakes. Though it was good for our ancestors to be large—outrunning predators and conserving thermal energy in cold winters was crucial for survival in their day—growing in the presence of good nutrition may be a vestigial response, given that those threats no longer persist. Being bigger, in other words, is no longer better.</p> <p>But one might argue that the large size of the human brain is a necessary condition for our high intelligence levels—so if we shrink ourselves down, we’ll dumb ourselves down, too. This is true in a sense, says Dean Falk, an evolutionary paleoanthropologist at the School for Advanced Research, in Sante Fe, New Mexico. If we rewound the evolutionary tape, we’d find that primate intelligence decreases with primate size. But Falk says a reduction in brain size doesn’t necessitate a corresponding decrease in intelligence. Over the last 20,000 years, internal restructuring and rewiring has already made <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2010/sep/25-modern-humans-smart-why-brain-shrinking" target="_blank">our brains smaller</a> without any apparent negative side effects. What’s more, shrinking wouldn’t be an unprecedented occurrence in our evolutionary history: <i>Homo floresiensis</i>, or “the hobbit species,” appears to have shrunk from <i>Homo erectus</i>, says evolutionary anthropologist Karin Isler, as a result of living in the limited-food environment of the Indonesian island of Flores. Despite brain volumes of 380 cm<sup>3</sup>, roughly the size of a chimpanzee’s, <i>Homo floresiensis</i>’ cognitive capabilities were comparable to Neanderthals, whose brain volume—at around 1200-1600 cm<sup>3</sup>—equaled or surpassed our own. </p> <p>Smaller brains may even have advantages. Brian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University, suggests that smaller brains tend be more social and have more of the traits we consider civilized. “Even though a wolf has a much larger brain than dogs, dogs are far more sophisticated, intelligent, and flexible,” he says. </p> <p>Still, Hendriks’ campaign for 50 cm is potentially dangerous, says Matthew Liao, a bioethicist at NYU. “If you were that small,” he says, “you’d be eaten by cats!” Like Hendriks, Liao <i>does</i> argue that, “in light of the problem of climate change,” humanity should consider shrinking, just not as much. In his paper “<a href="http://www.smatthewliao.com/2012/02/09/human-engineering-and-climate-change/" target="_blank">Human Engineering and Climate Change</a>,” he suggests we reduce our height by a more reasonable 15 cm, or 5 inches, which would merely reverse height’s artificial inflation in the last century. Liao has calculated that reducing the average US height by just 8 percent (15 cm) would mean a corresponding mass reduction of 23 percent for men and 25 percent for women, and a 15-18 percent reduction of metabolic rate. The effect of this downscaling “is not linear,” he says. “It’s exponential.” </p> <p>Liao would accomplish this height reduction through pre-implantation diagnosis, a screening test used to determine whether genetic or chromosomal disorders are present in developing embryos before they are inserted into mothers through in vitro procedures. While height would be somewhat trickier to test than most hereditary diseases—it is controlled by <a href="http://sciencenordic.com/scientists-discover-which-genes-determine-your-height" target="_blank">697 genetic variants</a>, in contrast to the single variant of a hereditary disease like cystic fibrosis—Liao views this as a mere “technical problem.” </p> <p>Once science works out the kinks, he says, parents could screen for tallness just like they do now for disease. </p> <p><br/></p><p><i>Susie Neilson is an editorial intern at </i>Nautilus.<br/></p>

When Samsø won, it became Denmark’s “renewable-energy island.”  Hermansen, then a teacher, rock musician, and self-described  rabble-rouser, took it upon himself to see that his native island lived  up to <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/the-science-hidden-in-your-town-name" target="_blank">its new name</a>.<br/></p><p>He brought consultants—and beer—to community meetings to try to convince his neighbors, many of them conservative farmers, to take up the cause. But the consultants weren’t getting through. So Hermansen sent them home. “Instead of telling people what they should do, I had to address the fear of change.” He told them that renewable technologies—wind turbines, solar arrays, biomass plants—would bring jobs and, better yet, money. Through subsidies, the government guaranteed a stable price for wind-generated power for 10 years, meaning investors could recoup their costs after seven or eight and start making a healthy profit.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR-meeting" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7573_685217557383cd194b4f10ae4b39eebf.jpg" alt=""/></figure> <p>That perked up their ears. Meeting by meeting, Samsingers—farmers, plumbers, schoolteachers, grocers—began to band together behind the project. When it finally got off the ground in the late 1990s, Samsø was putting 11 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. But by 2001, residents had cut their fossil fuel use by half. In 2003, they began exporting electricity to the mainland. Today the island produces from renewable sources 25 percent more energy than it consumes.</p> <p>What makes Samsø’s story so remarkable, however, isn’t this fast transformation from carbon polluter to renewable-energy producer. It’s how it happened: Samsø owes its success not to a collective environmental idealism, but to its residents’ brass-tacks business sense.</p> <p class="article-section-header article-section-header-diamond"><i class="icon-diamond"/></p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR-Kaempe-Hauge" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7574_c2ae5cb2426d96ed19a50b0b7d7c8e11.jpg" alt=""/></figure><p> <img src="http://static.nautil.us/7585_7eb5ac36014a76629c40069e46136a61.png"/> “The wind always blows here,” a grain farmer on Samsø told me. The steady resource allows the island to generate around 105 million kilowatt-hours per year with 11 land turbines, 10 offshore ones, and a smattering of micro-models. Residents use only about 24 percent of this electricity. They sell the rest.</p> <p>Ole Kaempe, a teacher on the island, and his wife Hedvig Hauge can see the turbine in which they invested from their farmhouse, whirring away beyond their vineyard. “Two of the wind turbines were offered to everybody; you could buy shares,” Kaempe says. “There was a lottery because too many people wanted in.”</p> <p>Listening to the low drone of his turbine now, he says, he hears the “music” of income.</p> <p class="article-section-header article-section-header-diamond"><i class="icon-diamond"/></p> <p>Two decades ago, most Samsingers heated their homes with oil hauled in on tankers. Then Hermansen and others got together and calculated that residents could save up to 50 percent on their heating bills if they replaced their furnaces with pumps that drew hot water, through underground pipes, from district heating plants.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR-house" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7596_1796a48fa1968edd5c5d10d42c7b1813.png" alt=""/></figure> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR-hay-2" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7588_7576182d0a84b1ba2207f8f061d48bc9.jpg" alt=""/></figure>  <div class="overlap-container"><aside class="overlap-img"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7587_717e15ebeb12bbe8061ef3c21578f463.jpg" alt="Brodner_CORNER-hay-to-oil"/></aside><div class="overlap-text"><p>Arne Jensen runs three plants fueled by straw bales, which he buys from  local farmers. (A fourth plant burns wood chips.) “It takes two and a  half kilos of this stuff to replace one kilo of oil,” he says. “This  plant processes 1,600 tons a year. If they replaced that with oil, they  would have to spend 20 million Danish krones [about $2.9 million], five  times as much. That would be 20 million going out of the community.  Instead, the money stays here.”</p> </div></div>  <p>The process is also, more or less, carbon neutral. The CO2  released during burning simply displaces the carbon that would have  entered the atmosphere naturally, as the straw decomposed. Even the ash  is repurposed as fertilizer.</p><p class="article-section-header article-section-header-diamond"><i class="icon-diamond"/></p><p>Samsø Golfklub, tucked in the island’s northeast corner, is a kind of  microcosmic showcase of the community’s embracement of sustainability.

Kasten Christiansen, a dairy farmer, warms his home with the  milk from his cows. “We have 2,000 liters of milk we have to chill every  day from 37 to 4 degrees Celsius for storage and delivery. It comes  here to this cooler, and the heat pump takes the difference in  temperature between the warm milk and the refrigerant and makes the heat  for the house. We’ve got pipes in the ground as well, in case we don’t  have enough from the milk. In the winter when it gets below zero, we  need the ground heat. In the spring, summer, and fall, there’s enough  from the milk alone.”</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR-milk-heat" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7591_274231193c4e40abc64d2f2d8cb6b415.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="article-section-header article-section-header-diamond"><i class="icon-diamond"/></p><p>Not everyone is happy with how things have shaken out. Jørgen Tranberg, a beef rancher on Samsø, owns two wind turbines—one on shore, one off—and a 6-kilowatt solar system. He warms his home with geothermal heat and sells straw to the district biomass plants. “I have spent 28 million Danish krone [$4 million] in energy, and that you don’t do just for fun. I was just a simple farmer!”</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR-Tranberg" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7593_3261769be720b0fefbfffec05e9d9202.jpg" alt=""/></figure> <p>For 10 years, he profited handsomely. But then his wind subsidies expired, and the government began erecting giant offshore turbine farms, increasing Denmark’s electricity supply and thereby driving down prices. “Right now, <i>nothing</i> is worth investing in!”</p> <div class="corner-art-right"><aside class="corner-art-img"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7594_f26bdcba3e7ea29ba3b9f8bc2555fefa.png" alt="Brodner_CORNER-Kristensen"/></aside><div class="corner-art-text"><p>Michael Kristensen, a project manager at Samsø’s Energy Academy,  believes Samsingers can lessen the loss from falling wind-energy prices  by creating more demand. “In the windy winter season, we actually  sometimes pay to export electricity to our neighbor countries,” he says.  “We could use this energy in electric vehicles, for making biogas for  the ferry, and in the district heating plants.”<br/></p> </div></div> <p>To stay true to its title of “renewable-energy island,” however, Samsø may need more help from the government. The island’s turbines are getting old and in desperate need of maintenance, but with electricity prices so low, residents like Tranberg are hesitant to buy replacement parts. Without incentives such as subsidies, Kristensen says, “there is a real threat that if an old turbine breaks down, it will be torn down instead of repaired.”</p> <p class="article-section-header article-section-header-diamond"><i class="icon-diamond"/></p> <p>But if the Samsø model can endure anywhere, it will be in places like Denmark, where tariffs on fossil fuels are driving investment in alternatives, says Jesper Kristensen, a development manager at the Energy Academy. “You can say that we have a good model here for the rest of the world.”</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Brodner_BR_ferry." data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7597_7a9e5de95f737b31cb6dfe05b616e644.jpg" alt=""/></figure><p><br/></p> <p><i>Steve Brodner is an illustrator and journalist.

            <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or the microbiologist Justin Sonnenburg, that career-defining moment—the discovery that changed the trajectory of his research, inspiring him to study how diet and native microbes shape our risk for disease—came from a village in the African hinterlands. </p> <p>A group of Italian microbiologists had compared the intestinal microbes of young villagers in Burkina Faso with those of children in Florence, Italy. The villagers, who subsisted on a diet of mostly millet and sorghum, harbored far more microbial diversity than the Florentines, who ate a variant of the refined, Western diet. Where the Florentine microbial community was adapted to protein, fats, and simple sugars, the Burkina Faso microbiome was oriented toward degrading the complex plant carbohydrates we call fiber. </p> <p>Scientists suspect our intestinal community of microbes, the human microbiota, calibrates our immune and metabolic function, and that its corruption or depletion can increase the risk of chronic diseases, ranging from asthma to obesity. One might think that if we coevolved with our microbes, they’d be more or less the same in healthy humans everywhere. But that’s not what the scientists observed.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Velasquez_BR-1" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7578_5e2b66750529d8ae895ad2591118466f.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>AN INSIDE VIEW :</strong> Microbiologist Justin Sonnenburg (left) is revealing how our refined Western diet may be upsetting ancestral metabolic processes and raising the risk of chronic diseases, from asthma to obesity. Graduate student Will Van Treuren looks on.</span><span class="credit">Photography by Peter van Agtmael/Magnum Photos, from Stanford University’s #nextgreatdiscovery Series</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>“It was the most different human microbiota composition we’d ever seen,” Sonnenburg told me. To his mind it carried a profound message: The Western microbiome, the community of microbes scientists thought of as “normal” and “healthy,” the one they used as a baseline against which to compare “diseased” microbiomes, might be considerably different than the community that prevailed during most of human evolution.</span><br/></p> <p>And so Sonnenburg wondered: If the Burkina Faso microbiome represented a kind of ancestral state for humans—the Neolithic in particular, or subsistence farming—and if the transition between that state and modern Florence represented a voyage from an agriculturalist’s existence to 21st-century urban living, then where along the way had the Florentines lost all those microbes?</p><p><span>Earlier this year I visited Sonnenburg at Stanford University, where he has a lab. By then he thought he had part of the answer. He showed me, on his computer, the results of a multigenerational experiment dreamed up by his wife, Erica, also a microbiologist.</span><br/></p> <p>When the Burkina Faso study was published, in 2010, the question of what specific microbes improved human health remained maddeningly elusive, but evidence was beginning to suggest that diversity itself was important. So despite their relative material poverty, these villagers seemed wealthy in a way that science was just beginning to appreciate.</p> <p>Where did that diversity come from? Humans can’t digest soluble fiber, so we enlist microbes to dismantle it for us, sopping up their metabolites. The Burkina Faso microbiota produced about twice as much of these fermentation by-products, called short-chain fatty acids, as the Florentine. That gave a strong indication that fiber, the raw material solely fermented by microbes, was somehow boosting microbial diversity in the Africans.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>How did the microbiome of our ancestors look before it was altered by sanitation, antibiotics, and junk food?</p> </blockquote><p><span>Indeed, when Sonnenburg fed mice plenty of fiber, microbes that specialized in breaking it down bloomed, and the ecosystem became more diverse overall. When he fed mice a fiber-poor, sugary, Western-like diet, diversity plummeted. (Fiber-starved mice were also meaner and more difficult to handle.) But the losses weren’t permanent. Even after weeks on this junk food-like diet, an animal’s microbial diversity would mostly recover if it began consuming fiber again.</span><br/></p> <p>This was good news for Americans—our microbial communities might re-diversify if we just ate more whole grains and veggies. But it didn’t support the Sonnenburgs’ suspicion that the Western diet had triggered microbial extinctions. Yet then they saw what happened when pregnant mice went on the no-fiber diet: temporary depletions became permanent losses.</p> <p>When we pass through the birth canal, we are slathered in our mother’s microbes, a kind of starter culture for our own community. In this case, though, pups born to mice on American-type diets—no fiber, lots of sugar—failed to acquire the full endowment of their mothers’ microbes. Entire groups of bacteria were lost during transmission. When Sonnenburg put these second-generation mice on a fiber-rich diet, their microbes failed to recover. The mice couldn’t regrow what they’d never inherited. And when these second-generation animals went on a fiberless diet in turn, their offspring inherited even fewer microbes. The microbial die-outs compounded across generations.</p> <p>Many who study the microbiome suspect that we are experiencing an extinction spasm within that parallels the extinction crisis gripping the planet. Numerous factors are implicated in these disappearances. Antibiotics, available after World War II, can work like napalm, indiscriminately flattening our internal ecosystems. Modern sanitary amenities, which began in the late 19th century, may limit sharing of disease- and health-promoting microbes alike. Today’s houses in today’s cities seal us away from many of the soil, plant, and animal microbes that rained down on us during our evolution, possibly limiting an important source of novelty.</p> <p>But what the Sonnenburgs’ experiment suggests is that by failing to adequately nourish key microbes, the Western diet may also be starving them out of existence. They call this idea “starving the microbial self.” They suspect that these diet-driven extinctions may have fueled, at least in part, the recent rise of non-communicable diseases. The question they and many others are now asking is this: How did the microbiome of our ancestors look before it was altered by sanitation, antibiotics, and junk food? How did that primeval collection of human microbes work? And was it somehow healthier than the one we harbor today?</p><p><br/></p>  <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he National Institutes of Health’s Human Microbiome Project, the first phase of which finished in 2012, was billed as a “road map” of human microbes. But as Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, a microbiologist at New York University who studies remote Amerindian communities, told me, the effort is “really the <i>American</i> microbiome project; it’s not the <i>human</i> microbiome project.”</p> <p>So a remarkable and somewhat quixotic effort has begun to catalog and possibly preserve, before they disappear, the microbes of people who live in environments thought to resemble humanity’s past—people whose microbiomes may approximate an ancestral state. Researchers are motoring down rivers in the Amazon, off-roading in the East African savanna, hiking into the mountain villages of Papua New Guinea. They see themselves as rushing to catalog an ecosystem that may soon disappear.</p> <p>“It’s really our last chance to harvest a lot of these microbes from around the world,” Rob Knight, a microbiologist at the University of California, San Diego, told me. “We have to do it before it’s too late—and it’s very nearly too late.”</p> <p>He and others suspect these populations won’t retain their traditional ways much longer. Antibiotics, thought to deplete microbes, are already used frequently in some communities. And as modernization and acculturation progresses—as these peoples move toward the sanitized, indoor-dwelling, junk food-eating reality that characterizes much life in developed nations today—some human microbes, or perhaps certain configurations of those microbes, may be lost forever.</p> <p>For now, scientists are careful to characterize the quest as purely descriptive; they want to know how these human microbiomes affect our bodies. Yet a kind of microbial ark—a storage vault for potentially endangered human microbes—is perhaps implied. Martin Blaser, a microbiologist at New York University and Dominguez-Bello’s husband, argues that because Westernized peoples may have lost important microbes, we may have to repopulate ourselves with microbes derived from more traditional-living populations—from, say, Amazonian Amerindians or African hunter-gatherers.</p> <p>That’s certainly a long way off. No one understands much about the dizzying variety documented so far—which microbes are good, which harmful, which irrelevant. One constant, though, is that people living subsistence lifestyles have tremendous diversity compared to westernized populations—up to 50 percent more species than North Americans or Europeans. That includes not only bacteria but eukaryotes—single-cell protists and large, multicellular worms. These organisms, which are often missing in the West, have <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/why-scientists-need-to-fail-better" target="_blank">historically been considered pathogens</a>. But some evidence now suggests that they can favorably shape the microbiome, benefiting the host.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Velasquez_BR-2" data-title="FAMILY GARDEN" data-capper="The Sonnenburgs,%u2028 to boost their own microbial diversity, took up gardening, got a dog, and began hand-milling grain to make bread.

Whereas North American microbes orient toward degrading fat, simple sugars, and protein, the microbes of subsistence communities so far studied are geared toward fermenting fiber.</span><br/></p> <p>Most study subjects live in the tropics; their microbial communities may reflect tropical environments, not an ancestral human state. Yet even “extinct” microbiomes from higher latitudes—including from a frozen European mummy—are similarly configured to break down plant fiber, adding to the sense that the Western microbiome has diverged from what likely prevailed during human evolution.</p> <p>The Sonnenburgs think fiber is so important that they’ve given it a new designation: microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, or MACs. They think that the mismatch between the Westernized, MAC-starved microbiome and the human genome may predispose to Western diseases.</p> <p>Scientists studying these communities suspect that while mortality is high from infectious diseases, chronic, non-communicable diseases are far less prevalent. At the same time, researchers since the late 20th century have repeatedly observed that even in the West, people who grow up on farms with livestock, or exposed to certain fecal-oral infections, like Hepatitis A and sundry parasites—environments that, in their relative microbial enrichment, resemble these subsistence communities—have a lower risk of certain Western afflictions, particularly hay fever, asthma, and certain autoimmune disorders.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Many who study the microbiome suspect we are experiencing an extinction within that parallels the extinction gripping the planet.</p> </blockquote><p><span>No one wants to bring back the killers of yore. But the suspicion—and the hope—is that beneficial microbes can be separated from the dangerous ones, and that “good” ones can be restored. Or perhaps we can simply treat the community we already harbor better by feeding it healthier fare.</span><br/></p> <p>The United States Department of Agriculture recommends between 25 and 38 grams of fiber for adults daily; most Americans consume substantially less fiber-rich food, including nuts, whole grains, certain fruits, and vegetables. The guideline stems, in part, from the research of an Irish-born physician named Denis Burkitt. While working in Uganda in the 1960s, Burkitt became convinced that the high-fiber African diet explained the Africans’ relative lack of colon cancer.</p> <p>The problem with the fiber hypothesis, however, has always been twofold. People who eat plenty of fiber seem to have a lower risk of many diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. But when scientists have fed fiber to volunteers, they haven’t historically observed much benefit. And this underscores the real mystery: By what mechanism does fiber improve health?</p> <p>Soluble fiber is an umbrella term for complex plant sugars—including some polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and fructans. The molecules consist of simple sugars linked together in long, hard-to-dismantle chains. If you dump a load of fiber—or microbiota-accessible carbohydrates—onto a colonic community of microbes, those that specialize in fermenting it will bloom. And they’ll start churning out short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, whose smell you might recognize from aged cheese, and acetate, which gives vinegar its sharpness.</p> <p>These acids, Sonnenburg thinks, are one of the long-sought mechanisms by which fiber prevents disease. Rodent studies suggest that as they diffuse into circulation, they stimulate the anti-inflammatory arm of the immune system—cells that help you <i>not</i> attack tree pollen and other harmless proteins—preventing allergies and other inflammatory diseases. The calming effect reaches as far as the bone marrow and lungs, where, as a recent <i>Nature Medicine </i>study showed, the acids reduced animals’ vulnerability to asthma.</p> <p>As Justin Sonnenburg put it, “We have this unsupervised drug factory in our gut.” The question facing microbiologists today is how to properly tend to that factory.</p> <p>Here, studies of populations living more traditional lifestyles may provide clues. In the past, most people likely imbibed many times more fiber than today. If you eat minimally processed plants, which humans have for millions of years, you can’t avoid fiber. Modern hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists certainly eat loads of it. The Hadza of Tanzania, for instance, consume at least 10 times more than Americans, in tubers, baobab fruit, and wild berries. Agriculturalists, like those Burkina Fasans, also eat more fiber than Western populations, in porridges and breads made from unrefined grains.</p> <p>Given this constant supply of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, human microbiomes of the past, the Sonnenburgs argue, likely produced a river of these short-chain fatty acids. That probably changed some with the transition to agriculture, which made diets less diverse. But an even more drastic shift occurred quite recently, with the advent and widespread adoption of refined foods. As a result, westernized populations, the Sonnenburgs think, have lost healthful, fiber-fermenting microbes. And we suffer from a kind of fermentation byproduct deficiency.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Velasquez_BR-3" data-title="HUNGRY MICROBES" data-capper="A healthy gut hosts a number of microenvironments.

When I visited Sonnenburg, he showed me one reason why: The ecosystem that produces the acids may be as important as the acids themselves. He brought up two cross-sectional images of fecal pellets still in mice intestines. Most microbiome analyses take a tally, from genetic markers, of what microbes are present and in what abundance. That’s equivalent to imagining what a forest looks like from a pile of wood chips, and gives little sense of how the forest was organized. By some ingenious tinkering, though, one of Sonnenburg’s post-docs had developed a way to freeze the ecosystem in place, and then photograph it.</p> <p>The resulting picture was unlike any rendition of the microbiome I’d seen before. One animal had eaten plenty of fiber, the other hadn’t. In the fiber-fed ecosystem, similar bacteria clustered with one another, not unlike schools of fish on a reef ecosystem. An undulating structure prevailed across space. But in the non-fiber diet, not only was diversity reduced, the microbes were evenly distributed throughout, like a stew boiled for too long.</p> <p>At this point, Sonnenburg sat back in his chair and went quiet, waiting for me to notice something. To one side of both images, microbes were mostly absent—the mucus layer on the lining of the gut. But that layer was twice as thick in the fiber-fed mice than the non-fiber fed. That difference amounted to about 30 nanometers, far less than the width of a human hair. But one day we may look back and shake our heads that Western diseases—from diabetes to colon cancer—stemmed from 30 nanometers of mucus that, somewhere along the way, went missing in the developed world.</p> <p>We think of the Western diet—high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and proteins—as overly rich. But what’s missing from the diet may be just as, and perhaps more, important than what’s abundant.</p> <p>Years ago, while still a post-doc, Sonnenburg discovered that something very odd occurs when those MAC-loving microbes go hungry. They start eating mucus. “This is the stage where you say, ‘Oh my God. They’re eating me.’ ” Sonnenburg said. “You can see it.”</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Our ancestral microbe variety may have faded over time due, simply, to our fiber-poor diet.</p> </blockquote><p><span>We need that mucus. It maintains a necessary distance between us and our microbes. And as it erodes with a poor diet, the lining of the gut becomes irritated. Microbial detritus starts leaking through. One of the more striking discoveries in recent years is that you can see this stuff, called endotoxin, increase in the bloodstream immediately after feeding people a sugary, greasy, fast-food meal. The immune system responds as if under threat, leading to the “simmering inflammation” the Sonnenburgs think drives so many Western diseases.</span><br/></p> <p>We need inflammation to combat infections, or aid tissue repair. But chronic inflammation—a danger signal blaring indefinitely—can lead to all manner of cellular dysfunction, contributing to many degenerative diseases.</p> <p>I came away from Sonnenburg’s office with a sense that I’d glimpsed a principle underlying our relationship with microbes. Wringing calories from wild, fibrous fare required a village—microbes specialized in distinct tasks, but each also dependent on its neighbors. The difficulty of the job encouraged cooperation between microbes. When you withheld fiber, though, you removed the need for that close-knit cooperation. The mutually beneficial arrangements began to fray.</p><p><span>Sonnenburg’s experiments help contextualize what others are finding in peoples who hunt and forage. The Hadza, one of the last remaining hunter-gatherers on Earth, live near Lake Eyasi in Tanzania, a region of east Africa thought to be the birthplace of our species. An analysis of their microbes published last year detailed an immensely diverse community, including a number of microbes new to scientists.</span><br/></p> <p>The Hadza harbor a variety of bacteria called treponema, which are absent in the developed world. They’re spirochetes related to the pathogen that causes syphilis. Every rural, non-westernized group studied so far, including various Amerindian groups, also have treponemas, as do our primate relatives.</p> <p>Cecil Lewis, a geneticist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman who studies the microbiomes of native people, including of Amerindian populations, suspects they may belong to an “ancestral microbiome”—a community that accompanied us since before we were human. Maybe anti-syphilis medication wiped them out in the West, Knight speculates. When I asked what they might do, or what their loss might mean, Lewis and others responded that no one really knows.</p> <p>Yet the treponemas have genes that help in breaking down complex carbohydrates, suggesting a role in fermentation. And that dovetails with the other striking feature of the Hadza and Amerindian microbiomes. Where we have just a few strains of, say, prevotella bacteria, the Hadza have a kaleidescopic variety. Again, diet is implicated. Breaking down tough, wild plants may require a diverse team of microbes. What happened to Western diversity? It’s possible we’ve inadvertently killed that wealth, or never possessed it at all. But another possibility, as Sonnenburg’s experiments suggest, is that because we haven’t fed those microbes, we’ve lost them. Our ancestral variety may have faded over time due, simply, to our fiber-poor diet.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Velasquez_BR-4" data-title="HEALTHY FIBER" data-capper="In the past, most people likely consumed many times more fiber than today.

Humans do not. One outstanding question is whether, if I began eating wild tubers and baobab fruit, the microbial complexity necessary to ferment the new fare would simply appear, seeded from the environment.</p> <p>Trials testing prebiotics, food for the fiber-fermenting bacteria, suggest that you can increase microbial richness with more fiber, and improve metabolic function. But here’s the wrinkle: In studies from Europe, only individuals who already harbored a baseline diversity benefitted from these dietary interventions. Those whose microbial communities were too impoverished didn’t—or couldn’t—respond to the new diet. They seemed to lack the ability.</p> <p>The Sonnenburgs point to these studies as evidence that we need the right microbes—their unique alchemical talents—to unlock nutrients from food. Where do we get them? Our particular genes can influence the makeup of our microbiome, perhaps influencing our propensity to develop disease or put on weight by shaping our microbial community. But another reason for lacking a bacterium is more straightforward: We may never have encountered it in the first place.</p> <p>Those environments where a relatively prolific sharing of microbes still occurs—daycares, cowsheds, homes with lots of siblings, and homes with dogs—seem to protect against allergies, asthma, some auto-immune diseases, and certain cancers. These observations, often grouped under the rubric of the “hygiene hypothesis,” appear to highlight a phenomenon separate from diet: access to microbial wealth, and possibly to unique microbial heirlooms.</p> <p>Consider the spiral-shaped, stomach-dwelling bacterium <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>. For at least a century, <i>H. pylori</i> has been declining in the developed world. Most of our great-great grandparents probably had it; now less than 6 percent of children do. Unlike the microbes that interest Sonnenburg, <i>H. pylori</i> doesn’t eat what we eat. It eats us, its host. And unlike microbes thought to jump aboard from food, water, soil, or other animals, <i>H. pylori</i> only comes from other people—particularly, scientists think, our mothers. It’s a human-adapted microbe that’s passed between generations.</p> <p><i>H. pylori</i> is infamous for causing ulcers and gastric cancer, but mounting evidence also suggests that, by subverting the immune system to ensure its own survival, the bacterium may protect against asthma, obesity, and possibly other inflammatory diseases. If there’s an ecosystem restoration project implicit in the study of the ancestral microbiota, <i>H. pylori</i> serves as an important counterpoint to the emphasis on diet. You can eat all the fiber you want (unless your food is contaminated with feces) and you’ll never re-acquire microbes like <i>H. pylori</i>. The only way to restore such microbes may be to deliberately reintroduce them.</p> <p>Even that idea is complicated. Years ago, Dominguez-Bello discovered a unique Amerindian strain of <i>H. pylori</i> in an isolated Amazonian tribe, a bacterium whose ancestors had presumably come over the Bering land bridge with the forebears of native Americans some 15,000 years ago. The native strain was disappearing, however. When people of different ancestries mixed in South America, Dominguez-Bello found, imported strains outcompeted native ones. African and European <i>H. pylori</i> strains were driving Amerindian ones extinct.</p> <p>Why did that matter? We may fare better with “our” particular microbes. A study on Colombians last year found that when people of primarily native American ancestry harbored imported European or African <i>H. pylori</i> strains, their risk of gastric cancer increased dramatically. The introduced bugs didn’t match the native genotype. And that mismatch seemed to increase the risk of malignancy.</p> <p>“This type of thing could be happening in many microbes,” Barbara Schneider, molecular biologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, and coauthor on the study, told me. “There’s no reason to think that helicobacter should be unique.”</p> <p>We might call this the “family heirloom” problem. Some fraction of our microbes may be uniquely adapted to our particular genetic quirks—to our particular branch of the human family. Once they’re lost, there may be no recovering these microbes. Meaning that, because I was born and grew up in the U.S., “my” helicobacters and treponemas may be gone forever.</p> <p>In their recent book, <i>The Good Gut: Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood, and Your Long-term Health</i>, the Sonnenburgs argue forcefully that boosting fiber intake is the best way to cultivate a healthier community of microbes. Given the many unknowns, their advocacy surprised me. The science wasn’t settled; what if they were wrong?</p> <p>They’d fretted over this scientific uncertainty, they said, but decided that the diet they pushed—really a variant of the Mediterranean diet—would probably not cause harm, and would likely benefit adherents, even if everything they thought about the microbiome was wrong.</p> <p>Not long after we spoke, Stephen O’Keefe, a gastroenterologist at the University of Pittsburgh, published what may be the best evidence yet (in people) that supports the Sonnenburgs’ microbiota-accessible carbohydrates hypothesis.</p> <p>O’Keefe has long puzzled over the high risk of colon cancer among African-Americans compared to native Africans. Like Burkitt 60 years ago, he suspected that a diet rich in fiber might explain what he quantified as a 65-fold disparity. To prove it, he put 20 rural South Africans on a high-fat, high-meat diet—including hot dogs, hamburgers, and fries; and he put 20 African-Americans on a high fiber African diet, including corn porridge, beans, and fruit. In contrast to earlier studies, however, his team visited the subjects at home, preparing their meals and supervising them.</p> <p>Changes occurred quickly. Inflammation of the colon, which increases the risk of cancer, decreased in the African-Americans on the African diet; and it increased in the Africans on the American diet. Production of the fermentation by-product butyrate, thought to prevent colon cancer, increased in those eating African fare, and declined in those eating American-style. And here’s what struck me: In the fiber-poor, meat- and fat-fed microbiome, O’Keefe saw a “loosening” of those tight-knit communities oriented toward fermenting fiber. He’d done in people what Sonnenburg had done in rodents—rattled the ecosystem—and it took just two weeks on an American-type diet. He also demonstrated that regardless of the microbes you may not have inherited, what you feed the microbes you have can make a big difference in how they behave.</p> <p>Years ago, impelled in part by their oldest daughter’s constipation problems, the Sonnenburg family revamped its diet. They threw out all processed food-stuffs, and began eating plenty of veggies and whole grains. They bought a dog. Justin Sonnenburg began hand-milling his own wheat berries for bread. He took up gardening. And when he compared his archived microbes from years ago with recent ones, he discovered that his microbial diversity had increased by half. “That’s a huge difference,” he told me, “as big as the difference between Americans and Amerindians.”</p> <p>It remains to be seen what detailed analysis will reveal about this diversification—how many came from his dog, from soil, from the sourdough he handles; how many might have been there all along in depressed numbers, and bloomed on a fiber-rich diet. What it showed the Sonnenburgs, however, was that without fully understanding how the microbiome works, you can still push it in a healthier direction.</p> <p>“If we wait to the point where we are beyond a shadow of a doubt, with double-blind studies translated to regulations, we’re going to be waiting decades,” Sonnenburg told me. “But right now, all the arrows are pointing in the same direction, toward fiber.”</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Moises Velesquez-Manoff is a journalist and author of </i>An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Velasquez_BR" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7563_0ce98f53e3aa229aa2f31b16e5dcbb4b.png" alt=""/></figure> <p><br/></p>

The glory of it!” John told Lawrence Weschler in a 2005 <i>Harper’s</i> article. “Nowadays—unlike during the Victorian era when the glory was all that got discussed—nowadays it’s the horror that always gets talked about. And either one by itself, of course, is a ridiculous half-statement.”</p>  <p>The “Ride of the Valkyries” was so deeply associated with the attack on Charlie’s Point, and had been for so long—from birth, so to speak—that we who were working on the film, editing the picture and mixing the sound, could barely conceive of separating the two. How that particular Solti recording came to be chosen, I never found out—the decision predated my joining the film—but there is a general consensus in musical circles that Solti’s interpretation, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, has never been surpassed.</p> <p>So it came as an existential shock when Decca, the record company in question, said firmly: No.</p> <p>There was so little time left that we were constrained to move forward along three fronts, hoping that at least one would pay off: 1) to continue to petition Decca; 2) to make arrangements to record the “Valkyries” with the San Francisco Symphony, trying to duplicate Solti’s dynamics and meter; and 3) to comb through all the existing recordings with the hope of finding one that was close to Solti’s interpretation and available to use in the film.</p> <p>The last of these approaches fell to me, since I was responsible for the sound design of the film as a whole, as well as being, at that time, the picture editor for this section of the film.</p> <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The problem with many of the versions of “Valkyries” that I rejected was they were monotonously rhythmic: The result was a robotic stagger, a simulation of musical life rather than the real thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was of course long before iTunes—the Apple II had only been recently released and the Macintosh was not yet gleaming in Steve Jobs’s eye—so our database of necessity was the Schwann catalogue of recorded music.</p> <p>It turned out that there were 19 stereo recordings of “The Ride” available in 1979, and I bought them all from Tower Records at the corner of Bay and Columbus in San Francisco.</p> <p>It was the musical equivalent of ransacking every bottle of burgundy—Gallo to Romanée-Conti—from the nearest wine shop. But as soon as I uncorked many of them, nestling the needle into the grooves of the LP, I knew that they wouldn’t work: There was a vinegary tang to them—certainly in comparison to the Solti—that made my eyes water.</p> <p>But a number of the others, perhaps half, deserved more serious consideration. How serious I was soon to discover.</p> <p>There is a complex rhythmic relationship in film between the visual action on screen and the music, whatever it might be. And during the editing of the film that relationship is constantly being adjusted and tightened, sometimes consciously, other times on a more intuitive basis.</p> <p>But that same complex relationship also takes place in the performance of the music itself, as the conductor balances, on a moment-by-moment basis, the rhythmic signature of the score, adjusting it to his interpretation and the particular strengths (and sometimes, weaknesses) of the orchestra he is leading.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="MAESTRO OF THE HEART" data-capper="The version of %u201CRide of the Valkyries%u201D by conductor George Solti (seen here) had the perfect rhythmic signature for the living and breathing pulse of the film." data-credits="Erich Auerbach"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7601_43207fd5e34f87c48d584fc5c11befb8.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>MAESTRO OF THE HEART:</strong> The version of “Ride of the Valkyries” by conductor George Solti (seen here) had the perfect rhythmic signature for the living and breathing pulse of the film.</span><span class="credit">Erich Auerbach</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The greatest conductors and orchestras, and Solti and the Vienna Philharmonic were certainly in that group, are able to shape these minute adjustments to the rhythmic signature so closely that they are <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/drums-lies-and-audiotape" target="_blank">perceived as regular but in fact are not</a>, thus enhancing the organic, living and breathing nature of the music itself. The problem with many of the versions of “Valkyries” that I rejected was that they were monotonously rhythmic: A metronomic signature had been decided upon and stuck to, regardless of circumstance. The result was a robotic stagger, a simulation of musical life rather than the real thing.</p>  <p>This is reflected in our intimate relationship with the rhythms of our own bodies, their heartbeat and breathing. We may think that most of the time our heartbeat is regular, but in fact it is not. It is constantly being micro (and sometimes macro) adjusted on a beat-to-beat basis, responding to neurological feedback between the heart, the brain, and the needs of the body for oxygenated blood. And the same applies to our rate of breathing, which is intimately related to our circulatory system.</p> <p>The medical term for a healthy but slightly irregular rhythm is “ectopic,” and it is our largely unconscious awareness of this dynamic pulse which reminds us that we are alive. In cases of medical emergency, that closely monitored feedback between the heart and the needs of the body is often weakened or severed, and a machine-like regularity of heartbeat appears, signaling trouble or impending death.</p> <p>Similarly, music that lacks this dynamic, quicksilver pulse is perceived, consciously or not, as lacking an essential spark of life.</p> <p>Solti’s conducting of the “Valkyries” was instead a sublime example of what we might call ectopic music—a powerful embodiment of the living, pulsing heart and breath of Wagner’s composition.</p> <p>When we had bound Solti’s “Valkyries” to that scene in Apocalypse, the DNA of both of music and film had become inextricably linked on the largest thematic levels—remember that the Valkyries themselves are god-like female virgins riding winged horses carrying the bodies of battle-slaughtered soldiers to Valhalla—as well as the miniscule metrics of film-frame and semiquaver.</p> <p>But as great as Wagner’s music is, and as wonderful as Solti’s recording is, we had taken a number of liberties.</p> <p>We had made a cut, after about 45 seconds, when the action suddenly shifts to the Vietnamese school and there is a shocking momentary silence, soon intruded upon by the distant sound of helicopters and the faint wafting of the music borne on the froth of whirring blades.</p> <p>This builds in intensity as the Air Cav gets closer, the teachers and students in the school begin to panic, and then the voices of the Valkyries are heard for the first time over a long shot of the helicopters, just specks on the horizon, with surf breaking in the foreground.</p> <p>Whenever I watch the film, the chemistry of music and image in the next section always strikes me as particularly miraculous: the shot of the helicopters from behind as they approach the beach, the Vietnamese soldiers running along their elevated walkways, jumping into trenches, and then a remarkable series of moving shots of the helicopters, the singing Valkyrie accentuating each cut, building in intensity until the beach is crested and the first shots are finally fired.</p> <p>There is a second cut in the music during a close shot of the muzzle of a mini-gun blasting its thousands of rounds a minute, and we reprise the previous section with the Valkyries vocal, although in a somewhat abbreviated form.</p> <p>We dropped the whole middle section of Wagner’s original, where the Valkyries are calling out to each other: “Here Helmwige, bring your horse here—Put your stallion next to Orlinde’s mare, your bay will enjoy grazing with my gray—Who is hanging from your saddle?”</p> <p>If we had included this, there would have been confusion along with a massive drop in energy. Instead, we take a break in the music for about 50 seconds to concentrate on dialogue between Kilgore and his men.</p> <p>Then as the helicopters begin to land on the beach, with the Marines jumping out under heavy Vietnamese fire, the “Ride” starts up again, this time with the powerful final section. When some secondary ordinance explodes, knocking the legs out from under one of the marines, the music comes to an end.</p> <p>So my task, desperately crucial given our dilemma, was to find another recording of the “Valkyries” as close as possible to the rhythmic signatures of Solti’s 1965 recording, that would also allow itself to be restructured in this way. I worked out a graph of the variations Solti’s rhythm, in 4-second increments, and with a stopwatch did the best I could to take the ectopic pulse of his music. It was a fantastic crash course in musicology, revealing like an X-ray the “Ride’s” hidden twists and turns, hesitations and accelerations.</p> <p>I applied the same technique to the other recordings, hoping to find a rhythm as near as possible to Solti’s. Recording after recording fell by the wayside, and in the end only one other “Valkyries” came close: Erich Leinsdorf’s 1977 recording with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="CHARLIE%20DON%u2019T%20SURF" data-capper="The%20late%20Sam%20Bottoms%20as%20surfer-turned-GI%20Lance%20Johnson%20and%20Robert%20Duvall%20as%20war-%20Lt.%20Col.%20Bill%20Kilgore%20during%20the%20attack%20on%20Charlie%u2019s%20Point%2C%20a%20scene%20forever%20associated%20with%20%u201CRide%20of%20the%20Valkyries.%u201D" data-credits="Courtesy%20of%20American%20Zoetrope"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7607_4efc9e02abdab6b6166251918570a307.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>CHARLIE DON’T SURF:</strong> The late Sam Bottoms as surfer-turned-GI Lance Johnson and Robert Duvall as war- Lt.

The ectopic rhythms were holding, and perhaps this delicate organ transplant was going to work after all. I smiled along with Kilgore as the trumpets blared. Then suddenly ...</p> <p>I stopped the machine, disoriented. There was something wrong with the image. There had always been a peculiarly wonderful strength and acidity to the blue of the ocean that had now disappeared. I asked my assistant, Steve Semel, if he had changed the print for some reason. No, he hadn’t.</p> <p>The problem turned out to be a classic case of synesthesia. At that point in the film—about 35 seconds from the start of the music—there are a series of shots featuring portraits of soldiers going into battle, the first one a down-angle shot of a rocket with the hand of marine caressing its breast, so to speak. In each of the shots the ocean is spread widely in the background.</p> <p>Although Leinsdorf’s performance of the “Valkyries” was rhythmically in synch with Solti’s, at this moment Leinsdorf had emphasized the strings in his orchestral balance, whereas at that same point Solti had chosen to emphasize the brasses, which—I realized now only in retrospect—were responsible for synergizing that wonderful acid blue of the ocean. In Leinsdorf’s recording, the strings were soft and pillowy, and as a result the blue looked dead: The chemistry of the image and sound worked against each other to the detriment of both. I turned off the machine and abandoned the search, letting Francis know the sad result. He understood the problem.</p> <p>As it turned out, Francis was able to get past Decca’s gatekeepers and talk to Solti himself in Chicago. Solti responded as one maestro to another, sympathizing with the artistic predicament Francis faced: “Of course, dear boy, why didn’t you talk to me in the first place?”</p> <p>The permission to use Solti’s “Valkyries” came through so late in the process, however, that we were not able to get hold of the magnetic masters in time, and what you hear in the film is a tape transfer from the LP disk, spread in re-recording to six channels of sound. But perhaps this contingency lends a certain serendipitous truth to the scene, since Kilgore himself, now revealed to be a connoisseur of music, would doubtless have also made his tape directly, as we did, from Solti’s Decca disk.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Walter Murch is a film editor, sound designer, writer, and director who has been working in motion pictures for 50 years.

            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the 1990s, during breaks from editing the film <i>First Knight</i>, starring Sean Connery, Walter Murch was reading <i>The Sleepwalkers</i>, a book on the history of cosmology, by the Hungarian-British writer Arthur Koestler. Murch was struck by a footnote to a passage about Pythagoras and numerology that mentioned “Bode’s law,” formulated in the 18th century, which holds that planets and moons orbit their hosts at predictable mathematical ratios. “The idea made me go ‘Hmmm,’ ” Murch says. “It percolated in my mind for the next six months or so and then for some reason it moved to the front of my agenda.” It has remained there ever since.</p> <p>Murch may be the world’s most vocal proponent of Bode’s law, also known as the Titius-Bode law, named after its two founders, and what it might say about the identity of the universe. He has given PowerPoint <a href="https://vimeo.com/125379787" target="_blank">lectures about its role</a> in our solar system and continues to collect NASA data about exoplanets. In the past few years Murch’s advocacy has gotten a boost from astronomers whose research, published in the <i><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6230" target="_blank">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</a></i>, has shown the law does indeed apply to numerous exoplanet orbits.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The world is musical. If there were no human beings on earth and the wind blew over a frozen lava tube, it would produce a tone; and if the wind blew a little harder it would produce harmonics of that tone.</p> </blockquote><p><span>Murch’s talks on the obscure law may be better attended than those by astronomers because anybody who is a casual film buff knows of his work and reputation. He is the sound editor of </span><i>The Godfather</i><span> and the film editor of, to name a few, </span><i>The Conversation</i><span>, </span><i>Apocalypse Now</i><span>, </span><i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i><span>, and </span><i>The English Patient</i><span>, for which he won Oscars for both Film Editing and Sound.</span><br/></p> <p>Murch, 72, has been a passionate student of science since he was a young man. He went to college intending to be an oceanographer before he fell in love with film. Over the long and adventurous course of his day job, he has continued to read deeply in science. He is a genuine Renaissance man. His passion for science, and Bode’s law in particular, converges with his job as an editor, helping directors refine the narrative line in their footage. “I tend to see in what I do what you might call strange attractors—patterns underneath the patterns that can be quantifiable,” Murch says.<i class="png-related" data-content-id="content-1288" data-title="[Walter Writes]" data-issue-id="43" data-chapter-id="149"/></p> <p>During his interview with <i>Nautilus</i>, Murch described and defended Bode’s law with verve and eloquence. I say “defended” because most astronomers today regard Bode’s law as not a universal law of orbital harmony but an intriguing coincidence. Reflecting Murch’s boundless curiosity and knowledge, our talk ventured from the solar system to the intersection of art and science, the nature of consciousness, and how Beethoven cracked open culture for the development of cinema. The legendary editor wove the manifold subjects into a cinematic conversation.</p> <p><i>The video interview plays at the top of the screen.</i></p><p><br/></p><center><a class="mobile button button_active_hover" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/album/3652395">View Video</a></center><p><b>Interview Transcript</b></p> <p><b>Who was Johann Titius?</b></p> <p>Johann Titius was a professor at Wittenberg University in Germany. His original name in German was Dietz, but when you got your Ph.D. in those days you Latinized your name because everyone wrote in Latin. So that Dietz became Titius, just like Kopernik became Copernicus.</p> <p>Anyway, he was translating a book by Charles Bonnet on the systems of nature and in those days—before footnotes or indexes or any of these things—translators were free to add whatever else they thought might go along with the concept. Titius interleaved in one of the pages an idea that he came up with, which was: If you take a very simple algorithm involving the low-integer numbers and apply the following doubling rules to it, it generates a series of numbers and those numbers are uncannily close to the distances of the planets from the sun. At that time, the furthest out planet we knew was Saturn and that has been true from ancient [times], whenever we started looking at the sky and trying to figure it out—let’s say 20,000 years ago. And so, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. Tellingly, the algorithm indicated something between Mars and Jupiter. There was an empty space there and Titius wrote in this book, “Would the good Lord have left this space empty? No!” And he kind of left it at that.</p> <p>There was not a lot of enthusiasm for it until about six years later, [when] Johann Bode, who was sort of the Carl Sagan of the 18th century—he was the head of the Berlin Observatory and a great popularizer of astronomy—picked it up. Initially, he kind of claimed it for himself. He algebracized it so that it looked more like a formula. Titius’ reading of it sort of looked like a Julia Child recipe. Take this number, do this to it, and so on! But now, you could actually look at a little formula.</p> <p><b>Is there a mathematical formula for the Titius-Bode law?</b></p> <p>What the formula is doing is just a simple geometric progression, but it’s referring to an item somewhere in the middle of the geometric progression as its point of reference—and much better if you have one of those formulas to use the start of the formula rather than something in the middle as your point of reference. So when you simplify it, it starts to look like formulas from music—harmonic series. Knowing as much or as little as I do of these things, I began to pursue that and discovered that if you take Bode’s law, and by inference the actuality of the semi-major axes of the planets, in fact their relationship is musically harmonic according to what we might call “just intonation,” which is music before human beings started fiddling around with it.</p> <p>The world is musical. If there were no human beings on earth and the wind blew over a frozen lava tube, it would produce a tone; and if the wind blew a little harder it would produce harmonics of that tone according to the laws of “just intonation.” For our complex needs, we have skewed things a little bit so that we can transpose between keys easily with keyboard instruments, and this is the even-tempered scale that we use today. But this is not what we’re talking about! The differences are not huge, but they’re significant—it’s like 2 or 3 percent.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The solar system is still very strange. We haven’t seen other solar systems out there like ours. That may be a consequence of the fact that we just haven’t been looking hard enough and long enough yet.</p> </blockquote><p><b>What happened when Sir William Herschel discovered Uranus?</b><br/></p> <p>So then people started to wake up to it because science, the Holy Grail of science, is a formula that is both descriptive of what we know and predictive of things that are going to be later discovered. So here was a formula that described everything we knew in 1766, but in 1781—or whenever it was that Herschel discovered it—sure enough, there was something there. This heated up the excitement for discovering something at this missing gap between Mars and Jupiter.</p> <p>A group known as the Celestial Police was formed and it was a pan-European—kind of like CERN, you know—group of astronomers led by Wilhelm Olbers, of Olbers’ Paradox. But they were beaten to the punch by a Sicilian priest-astronomer, Giuseppe Piazzi, who very similarly to Herschel was just scanning the skies and said, “oh, there’s a comet!” He followed it for three days I think, and then he got sick. He sent out letters. By the time he recovered, whatever that was had fallen into the glare of the sun and [he] couldn’t identify it anymore. It turned out to be Ceres, the center of the asteroid belt, and it also turned out to be within 1 percent of where this algorithm said it was.</p> <p>At that point, everyone was disarmed by it and it was called Bode’s law popularly—officially, the Titius-Bode law. And so it was for the next 45 years or so until the next planet out was discovered, which was Neptune. Neptune did not fit. They were looking for it to fit because everything else fit, but when the next planet out was identified, it was 50 percent off; it was much closer than it should [have been]. At that point, the law began a very quick tumble into obscurity, from which I’m trying to rescue it!</p> <p><b>Why do you want to rescue Bode’s law?</b></p><p>I love underdogs, I guess? You know, there’s a championing of the underdog. I translate the poetry of Curzio Malaparte, who is similarly, an Italian writer of the middle of the 20th century. He was very well known at the time that he was writing, but has since fallen into the same kind of obloquy and forgetting. Interestingly, I discovered his work in a book on cosmology, where one of his stories was brought out as an example of what the French call <i>surfusion</i>—which is what [in] English we call “supercooling”; but similarly, I love his work and he’s forgotten.</p> <p>Similarly with Titius Bode, the fact that it has the success that it has … if you study astronomy as an undergraduate, in Astronomy 101, Titius-Bode is explained to you for historical reasons and then it’s beaten to a pulp in front of your eyes and you are told, if you think this way you will never be an astronomer, because this is numerology and we discredit this! So [for] people who become astronomers, deep in their educational past is the witnessing of a bloody pulp, and they don’t want to be that bloody pulp.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Just as salt is inherent in the quark soup a nano-billionth of a second after the Big Bang in mysterious ways, so consciousness is also inherent in all of the previous examples of emergent qualities as they come along.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Astrophysicist Caleb Scharf has said Bode’s law is at worst a coincidence and at best a consequence of power laws of planet formation. Yet it has no reliable predictive power.</b><br/></p> <p>It’s valid. The power law, what he’s talking about, I would interpret as this doubling thing.</p> <p>One of the peculiarities of the law is that the solar system is still very strange. We haven’t seen other solar systems out there like ours. That may be a consequence of the fact that we just haven’t been looking hard enough and long enough yet; and that the Kepler telescope broke and so it’s not generating any new data—we’re just combing it for data that we have; but there are peculiar things about our solar system, which is that the first planet in our system, Mercury, is a very large multiple of the diameter of the central object, the sun—and that’s something we’re absolutely not seeing out there. We’re seeing lots of so-called Hot Jupiters. These are very big planets, very close to the central object; they’re almost like double-star systems with the second, the planet, being a star that didn’t ignite—wasn’t massive enough to ignite. So that’s a kind of an asterisk to that observation.</p> <p>I believe that Bode’s law is dynamic, meaning [that] in the case of Neptune, for instance, there is a moon far out that was clearly a captured Kuiper Belt Object and it is farther out within the Neptune system than Pluto is within our system—it’s the next iteration out; and it [has] an extremely elliptical orbit. It’s the most elliptical object that we know of in the solar system other than some comets; but it nonetheless fits Titius-Bode.</p> <p><b>If Titius-Bode is a universal law, what would account for it?</b></p> <p>Well, let me just also say that there is a long tradition of this issue, which is that with Kepler’s understanding of elliptical orbits, there was no possible way that anyone could understand why they should be elliptical. That condition pertained for the next 50 or 60 or 70 years; and in fact it drove a certain part of 17th-century science crazy because they had had to abandon Aristotelian and Ptolemaic astronomy, but there was nothing to replace it yet, and causally.</p> <p>It was believed, even as late as Copernicus, that planets moved around because they were being pushed by angelic forces; angels were pushing their hotdog carts around the circle of the … Newton came along and explained what was going on—with his theory of universal gravitation. He in turn punted downfield, why does that work? And he said famously, “<i>Hypotheses non fingo</i>,”—I don’t know! I’m just reporting how it works not why it works, and he said, I have no idea of why it works. So we had to endure another 250 plus years until Einstein came along and said well, really it’s not a force; if you think of it as a force, it’s a distortion in the four-dimensional time-space field that looks like a force.</p><p><span>The saving grace for both Kepler and Newton is that their theories were extremely useful. You could use Kepler’s formulas to make much better maps of the heavens, and astronomical predictions by an order of magnitude, and that was very useful for navigation and other purposes. Newton obviously, his formulas were very useful for killing people with using artillery. You could calculate artillery by several orders of magnitude. There is no utility yet—we don’t know—for Bode’s law so that’s another stake in its heart. Why should it be? We don’t know. Is it useful? No. Get rid of it.</span><br/></p> <p>In terms of speculation—and you know, I emphasize here that this is, let me call it, pure artistry, rather than … but that’s frequently how things emerge—you can think of … what Bode’s law says basically is that there is a central body and at a certain distance from the central body there is a zone in which if a planet or something is orbiting, it will eventually get pulled into the central body. In physical metaphors, it’s like it slides downhill into the center of the well. But at a certain place, there’s a breakpoint at which stable orbits become possible, and there is a corrugation of a kind from that point on—and you could think of it, kind of, in two- three-dimensional terms as an undulating landscape with peaks and valleys, peaks and valleys, and the planets or moons will tend to orbit at the bottom of these valleys. Now are these real? Or are they statistical? Who knows. By the same token, there are peaks where planets will not form stable orbits so the prediction—of my version of Bode’s law—is not only should you find planets here, but <i>here</i> you should not find any planets. And then the period to the next valley is double the distance from the previous valley. So this is the geometric progression. I should say [that] this also [relates] to music in the sense that it’s like an octave, that from the point of this—what we were calling this breakpoint, where stable orbits become possible—the measurement to Venus, if you double that distance, then you get the Earth; if you double the distance from this breakpoint to Earth, you get Mars; and then Ceres, then Jupiter, and so on.</p> <p>There is an undulation in something. What is that something? Are we talking about some reemergence of the ether? Are we talking about undulations in the fabric of space-time? I mean we all know, thanks to Einstein, that in the case of the central large body, space-time is curved in that, and that’s why starlight will veer around massive bodies. That was the proof of Einstein’s theory of general relativity by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1918, I think. So my supposition, and it’s purely a way of thinking about it, is [that] in addition to this curve bending down toward the central body, that from that outward, there is a very light undulation that is easy in the short term—it’s so light that it’s invisible in a sense, and any orbit is possible—but over the long term, things tend to fall into these troughs.</p> <p><b>Could Bode’s law be nothing more than the human need to see patterns?</b></p> <p>Sure. When I give lectures about this, the third slide is the word “apophenia,” which is the tendency of human beings to see faces in clouds and the face of Jesus in a piece of toast and that kind of stuff.</p> <p>I begin the lecture by saying this is an occupational hazard of anyone who does this kind of stuff, and it’s particularly true of me. I have to watch out for it because that’s my job. My day job is film editing, and that’s what I do—identify patterns and organize them at the micro- and macro- level to give you the best experience of watching a film possible.</p> <p>The other thing is that that is perhaps what freed me, because I have this multi-disciplinary approach. I know about music and I know about—to the extent that I’ve studied it—the history of this problem; and we now have the database and I’m putting these things together and I’m not burdened by what we might call, “the bloody pulp problem,” which is, “I don’t want to ever go there.” Just the opposite. Bode’s law, to me, seems to have been unfairly dismissed historically at a time when we didn’t have any data, meaning in the middle of the 19th century. The very first thing that did not fit Bode killed it. But at that time we knew very little in terms of celestial objects, even within our solar system, let alone other systems in the galaxy. Now that we have all this data, I think it’s time to relook at this.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>A critic listening to one of Beethoven’s pieces said Beethoven puts together doves and crocodiles in the same cage. If you had to boil down what movies are, we try to put crocodiles and doves into the same cage and see what happens.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Where do you see the intersection of art and science?</b><br/></p> <p>Well, there was a very interesting diagram. Charles Simonyi published a book that his father had written. His father taught physics in Hungary—was a very famous teacher, in fact, and did not publish this book himself, but this was his lecture notes. Charles Simonyi, a number of years ago, published this book.</p> <p>In the book, early on is a diagram of a flow chart over time and the ancient past is high, the present is low; and on the left is art and on the other side is science; and what he’s tracking is pulses of art—where art is advanced and where it is not advanced, where is it advanced and not advanced; where breakthroughs are being made and development is very rapid and areas of stagnation. And on the other side is science, where science is advancing and where it is regressing; where it’s stagnant, where it’s progressive. What’s fascinating about that diagram is that the two pulses are sequential, in the sense that the art pulse always precedes by a century or so the science pulse, and breakthroughs in art, in a sense, break up the hard pan of the soil and fertilize it and add compost to the mix, and then the fruit of science, the plant of science can find … its roots can dig down and develop. That’s, I think, one of the things that’s going on, those two different modes of thinking are complementary and they both need each other and they both work sequentially.</p> <p>The great thing about Simonyi’s diagram is that the distance between the ticks on the diagram are 50 years, not two years—I don’t know how it exactly applies at the more micro level. It’s clear that around the turn of the century, with the development of motion pictures—which is basically the quantization of movement, breaking movement down into discrete frame moments—that 10 years later, along comes Max Planck and gives us the idea of the quantum, first bursts upon the scene in 1900, which is also the year at which films began to be edited and put together to tell a coherent story out of parts that are not shot in sequence. So those two things, quantum mechanics and quantum analysis and the development of motion pictures in the first 28, 29 years of the 20th century are kind of yoked together.</p><p><b>Are you saying that science needs narratives?</b><br/></p> <p>Yeah. I mean the big leap I think that we’ve made in science over the last 100 years, is the, well, 200 years let’s say, is the idea that at deeper and deeper levels, there is a history to the organization of the universe. If you read the Bible, there is a history—it takes place over seven days and then that’s it! So out of the chaos of the primal elements, God fashions the world in seven days, or six days, and then rests on the seventh day.</p> <p>What we see when we look far enough back into the past is an era of complete, indistinguishable chaos, the pulse of a soup of hot quarks; and if an intelligence was somehow able to see that at the time, it’s very unlikely that that person, whoever that person could ever be, would say oh yes, I see a moment where Walter is in the offices of <i>Nautilus</i> having a discussion about this! If you looked at that soup of indistinguishable quarks, every quark is very similar to every other quark—they have different electrical values, different masses, but to predict the complexity of the universe that we now see would be a leap upon leap upon leap.</p> <p>This is something that we know now that we did not know 200 years ago and it is a story. We can see the emerging kind of, victory over entropy in a sense, that soup of quarks fits every description we could imagine of an entropic state—great chaos, complete uniformity; looking back into the past with cosmic radiation, we cannot distinguish variation greater than one over 100,000 in the temperature at recombination, which was 380,000 years ago. So what was it at the moment of the Big Bang? Much, much less even, than that!</p> <p>So how did complexity arise out of great chaotic simplicity? We don’t really know. We can track each thing: Well, there was a moment at which quarks came together to form protons, but electrons, which were there, could not be captured by these protons because the energy was still too great. Then there is a moment where the universe is expanding and cooling at the same time and now a new era of stability happens where atoms are being formed; but you still couldn’t have molecules because the energy is too great. And on and on and on.</p> <p><b>So how do you define consciousness?</b></p> <p>It’s a tool I think that we can use to think about these things. Consciousness is known as the hard problem because there is clearly some bifurcation going on. It’s the contact point between the reality that we can perceive and a reality that we have not yet perceived.</p> <p>One of the things that we see in this emergence is hierarchical organization and emergent qualities in the sense that you take two slightly poisonous, nasty substances—sodium and chlorine—and put them together and they turn into table salt, which is what we need; but there is no saltiness in either of those atoms. There is saltiness in the molecule. That saltiness does not become operative until you have a large enough mass of that and that mass is interacting with other masses in a salty way.</p> <p>I think this is probably a question that we will be able to resolve, which is the following: Is consciousness an emergent quality that’s inherent in the universe in the same sense that salt was inherent in sodium and chlorine but not predictable by sodium and chlorine? Salt is inherent in the protons of hydrogen. It’s inherent, in a sense, in the quarks that form the protons. Or is it?</p> <p>So my question to the universe—and to myself obviously—is, is consciousness a trivial epiphenomenon like the antlers of the Irish elk, meaning is it a strategy that a certain form of life, us, is using to gain an advantage over other forms of life? And is that advantage sexually attractive, in the larger sense of the term? Somebody who is not conscious is not very sexually attractive. And to an Irish elk, a girl, the guy with the big antlers, is very attractive because he’s able to sprout these things and then to support their weight and that means he’s a good dad, his sperm will be good, so I’m going to mate with him. The problem in there, the unintended consequence of that, is that [it] became a classic example of runaway evolution where the bigger the antlers got, the bigger they got; because you kept fathering with guys who had bigger antlers. Finally, it became a disaster because the antlers got bigger than the average distances between the trees in prehistoric Ireland and so they all died out.</p> <p>There’s an argument to be made that consciousness is that, that we’re running away with consciousness; it’s building on top of itself. We’re creating a world in which people live virtually all the time and we’re endangering ourselves in global warming and dah, dah, dah and we may get snuffed out because our “antlers” got too big for our britches in a sense. Alright, that’s the pessimistic point of view.</p> <p>Or is consciousness like salt? Meaning, is it something that at this point in the history of the cosmos—13.7 billion years along from the Big Bang—things have gotten stable enough and complex enough that consciousness can emerge, but that it is going to emerge whenever these conditions are right? And just as salt is inherent in the quark soup a nano-billionth of a second after the Big Bang in mysterious ways, so consciousness is also inherent in all of the previous examples of emergent qualities as they come along. And one of the teleological goals of the universe is to produce consciousness and if it happens on Earth, that’s great—we’re a good place for consciousness to emerge; if we blow it, it’s a tragedy, but the universe is a very big, perhaps infinite, place and there may be other places where consciousness will emerge and it will be able to get over the hump that we’re teetering at the edge of right now.</p> <p><b>Did you have an epiphany that ignited your passion for science?</b></p> <p>Well yeah. One of those moments where I go, “oh, okay, that’s interesting!” was Loren Eiseley’s work. He’s an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania and he wrote a book called <i>The Immense Journey</i> in the late 1950s I think, which I read at the time, so I was in my mid-teens.</p> <p>One particular example that stuck out was when flowers ruled the world, or when flowers conquered the world, something like that; and he made the point, which is very much along the lines that we’ve been talking, which is that flowers emerged—there were no flowers before 150 million years ago; that evolution had not discovered flowers and that flowers came along at a certain point in our evolutionary history and they burst upon the world. If you were looking at the Earth from far enough away with an accelerated timeframe, you would see the Earth and you would see, in the geological instant, you would see flowers. They were so efficient at what they did that they took over because, and this was his point, they resolved an ethical, existential dilemma, which was an arms race that the plants and other forms of life, notably insects, had been waging. Insects would attack plants with ever more fiendish proboscis, and plants would defend themselves with ever more poisonous thick bark, sticky substances that would trap insects.</p> <p>So there was an arms race basically, evolutionary speaking, for hundreds of millions of years between plants and insects until some genius—I’ll just say that, who knows what that means—plant said wait a minute, what’s going on here? These guys are attacking us [and] we’re never going to stop them from attacking us, but we can localize the attack. We will go against the received wisdom, which is defense, defense, defense, and actually invite attack; but we will localize the focus of that attack and we’ll advertise—“eat here!”—a flashing neon sign of a flower and scent that will broadcast over the airwaves, “come here and we will deliver goods (meaning nectar) to that place” or fruit that will give these insects something to eat so they won’t bother us in our core. These things will drop off; they’re localizable and dispensable and—and this is the really genius part—we will put seed or pollen at that point so that when the insect or bird or whoever it is, comes to, “eat at Joe’s,” they will take away, unbeknownst to them, pollen and seeds; and because they are intelligent, they are vectored, and that bee or wasp or bird will fly to that other tree over there and go exactly to that flower and to eat, again, at Joe’s, but they will pollinate that flower. Before that, we flowers or plants have been depending on random events to pollinate—wind, water, which are unintelligent; we have to rely on chance for the pollination to take place. Now, with insects being vectors, we no longer have to do this. So it was a brilliant discovery of evolution that both utilized the tools of the insects—so all of the aggressive tools that the insects had used, the long proboscis, were great at doing exactly what was required of them by these flowers and vice versa.</p> <p><b>The blend of nature and art is epitomized by the story of Beethoven basing the famous four notes of his “Fifth Symphony” on the sound of a Yellowhammer bird.</b></p> <p>He was part of the Romantic movement and it was reacting against the Classical movement in the last generation and their models, the previous generation’s models, which includes Mozart and Haydn, was architectural musically. They would invite you into an architectural space, musical, and they would point out the architecture. They would iterate the different themes—“look at this” and “look at these patterns.” Each movement of one of their works is like a room in a palace and when they pointed out everything of interest in that room, they leave the room and we move to the next room, the next movement, and this is a different architecture and we point out all of those things. But there is a consistency to the architecture within each room.</p> <p>Beethoven threw that all away with his woodpeckers because he didn’t use architectural models; he went out into nature and he walked around in the woods or in Vienna—or wherever he happened to be—and he was inspired by nature, which is not rigidly architectural. You can have things suddenly bursting in—suddenly the sun comes out in the middle of a gloomy day, or suddenly there are clouds of insects around me, or suddenly it’s muddy where I am. His early work, when listened to with classical ears, sounded like the ravings of a madman because he was not consistent within a movement; he would develop something and then right at the moment of development, he’d abandon it. He would abandon massive instrumentation and everything would become now a single instrument—<i>toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot</i>—and then from somewhere else, these other things would come in. There was a French critic listening to one of Beethoven’s pieces—I forget which one—that said Beethoven puts together doves and crocodiles in the same cage! And that in fact has very much influenced all of the 19th century … and if you had to boil down what movies are, we try to put crocodiles and doves into the same cage and see what happens.</p> <p>I can argue, when I have a lecture, where I say Beethoven was one of the people who invented cinema—that if you listen to Beethoven, you can hear the grammar of cinema being developed. There are cuts, there are fades, there are dissolves; there are alternating dialogues and sudden transitions in the middle of a scene to vast long shots; and then the musical equivalent of close-ups; and great dynamics; and very, very different than the generation that preceded him. The fact that the 19th century was steeped in Beethovenism was one of the things, I think, that allowed the invention when motion pictures came along, which are technically predisposed to this kind of doves and crocodiles stuff. It allowed cinema to coalesce as an art and as a medium extremely quickly when you consider what’s really going on. How did this thing become part of our culture so fast? We’re celebrating this year the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of <i>Birth of a Nation</i>, which is arguably the beginning of the experience of watching feature films. And that was barely 20 years after the mechanical invention of motion pictures.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>So when unfortunate things happen to us, it may simply be that we are dogs on the operating table and something’s going on that we just have no idea about.</p> </blockquote><p><span>The extension of this idea is that cinema was really invented by three people: Edison or Lumière—pick your poison—invented the mechanical nature of what was going on. Neither of them, Edison nor the Lumière brothers, saw really any profound future for this—maybe education, maybe documentation, great speeches we can record, but they did not suspect what has come to pass. Beethoven gave us dynamism, which motion pictures are very adept at; and Gustave Flaubert and the Realist movement, paying close attention to the surfaces of realism and extracting poetry out of that, is the other thing that cinema is very good at. So the dynamical representation of closely observed reality, which is a very good thumbnail for what cinema is, was contributed by Flaubert and Beethoven; Edison came along and capped it with the mechanism that would allow this to happen. But if you think about the 19th century, it was dominated by the novel and the symphony, those were the two main art forms. And it was dominated by the realistic novel, courtesy of Balzac certainly, but Flaubert by the middle of the century, and Beethoven from the beginning on—so these two streams had thickly developed all through the 19th century and then along came a medium that was the perfect environment, the bay in which these two streams could flow together and mix.</span><br/></p> <p><b>Do you fear your views veer from science into metaphysics?</b></p> <p>Well, I’m a believer in metaphysics. I think that the reality that we perceive is not the end of it. Similar to what we were talking about before, in terms of the hierarchical organisation of the universe, which is news to us, meaning in the last six or seven generations of human thought, this idea of developmental hierarchy over time, we are still coming to terms with; and what goes along with that is what we were talking about earlier in terms of the emergent qualities, that life is an emergent quality—it is not predicted by the molecules that preceded it. And molecules, like salt, are emergent and not predicted by the elements that make them up. So you have things coming together to produce something that is not predictable or even perceivable by the elements below it. Can sodium perceive salt? Can a cell in my liver perceive me? I don’t think so. It’s busy doing its cell thing and it’s very intelligent at doing that. It’s very, you know, “I’m doing it!” I think even that cell is not aware that it’s part of a liver, in the large sense, and it’s certainly not aware that there is a kidney over here and that there’s a brain up here and that I’m talking to you right now. It would be aware if I started becoming an alcoholic and it would say “what’s going on? How can I cope with this?” And the liver as a whole suffers and each of the cells suffer, as a result. But the point is [that] it’s very presumptuous of us who are basically sodium and chlorine here to think that we are the end of it. Yes, we can perceive everything that we can perceive, and we can perceive downward pretty efficiently thanks to science—we’re discovering the Higgs boson for crying out loud—but constitutionally, I would say, it’s impossible for us to scientifically perceive upward. We have intuitions about that, which is the whole idea of religion, and a lot of those intuitions are wrong. They’re wrong because they’re probably too simple, and they’re wrong because what gets tied in with them is observations about the real world. There is a kind of science in the Bible of, don’t eat pork, don’t eat shellfish, these things, behavioral stuff; but what are these based on? We now know what they’re based on and we can see the larger picture because we’re further down the road, so my hunch is that, I mean it’s a hunch, but a belief is that there are many levels beyond us and I don’t know what those levels are but I know that they are there and that they impinge upon us in the same sense that me becoming an alcoholic impinges upon this poor cell somewhere in my liver—why are you doing this?</p> <p>William James wrote very nice essays about this, in terms of the relationship between dogs and humans—that dogs are part of the human envelope. We love dogs, dogs are part of our consciousness in a sense. There are things that dogs do that we can’t participate in—their olfactory world is not something that we can get—but by the same token, a dog looking at us, we are very peculiar: Why is my master sitting there staring at an object (which we know to be a book) and he’s just frozen like a statue? We should go for a walk! And then that poor, unfortunate dog gets caught and taken to a laboratory and vivisection is done on it and, “Why are you doing this to me?” We can never explain and it can never understand the reasons for that and then you get into a kind of dialogue sort of, God and Job, which is “why?” Well, it’s a part of a bigger picture that you can never understand, that’s why. We are operating upon you to make medical breakthroughs that you cannot understand and I’m sorry about that. So when unfortunate things happen to us, it may simply be that we are dogs on the operating table and something’s going on that we just have no idea about. It can also be pure chance; I mean if the next asteroid comes in on Tuesday, too bad! It was great while it lasted. What did it mean? I think that there is probably, speaking metaphysically, that our relationship to consciousness and existence is very time-based. What’s out there? Time is not so much a factor and so that things that have happened in the past are still present in a way that we just can’t even begin to grapple with.</p>

            <p><span class="dropcap mqw">W</span>hen Ruth Behar moved from Cuba to Israel and then to a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, in 1962, she was shunted into the “dumb class.” There she met another challenged student, Shotaro, from Japan. Together the two friends, age 6, helped each other learn English while inhabiting what Behar, now a professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Michigan, calls the “liminal space,” that in-between place where what has been is no more and what will be is not yet.</p> <p>Behar found that to pass from one culture to another, to traverse the chasm of the liminal, language was the bridge. As she mastered English, she was able to help her parents navigate a new country and achieve success herself in school. “I think, dream, and live much of my life in the English language,” Behar wrote in a 2011 article. Due in no small part to her mastery of English, she wrote the beautiful <i>Traveling Heavy: A Memoir In Between Journeys</i>, about her family’s peripatetic movement, over generations, from Poland and Turkey to Israel to Cuba, where her parents were immersed in the island’s Jewish community.</p> <p>Today Behar, 57, who travels constantly, is a remarkable embodiment of the conclusions in her anthropological work: Home may not be within a family or even a single culture, but between cultures and communities and constantly on the move. Home as we have conceived of it since the agricultural revolution is nearing an end. Now we seem to be returning to the life of the nomad. Some of us wander by literally traveling the world; still more are nomads in place, navigating a string of temporary jobs or immersive online worlds. However we make the journey, we are redefining home. And that home is redefining us.</p> <p>In recent years, anthropologists have spotlighted a new generation at “home in the diaspora,” in Behar’s words. For them the liminal is not life’s interlude, but life itself. While being uprooted results in lost jobs, broken relationships, and, as cultural anthropologist Anthony D’Andrea says, “displaced minds,” scientists are finding benefits to life in the liminal lane. The more time we spend in alien realms, they say, the more likely we are to perceive the world in ways we could never otherwise imagine, evoking a perfect backdrop for fevered creative work, learning, and personal growth. “When you thrust yourself out of your usual context,” Behar says, “you find out who you are.”</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Preview Weintraub_BREAKER" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/2055_9afefc52942cb83c7c1f14b2139b09ba.png" alt=""/></figure> <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he notion of a liminal period was introduced in the early 20th century by French anthropologist and folklorist Arnold van Gennep, who wrote about rites-of-passage ceremonies across cultures, from totem clans in Australia to Roman Catholic priests. Traditional rituals like baptisms, Bar or Bat Mitzvahs, and weddings marked transitions between a prior identity, time, or way of living and a future self. Such rituals generally involved separation from the group, a period of transition (the liminal state), and reincorporation. The liminal space—for instance, the rite of passage called Walkabout, in which male Australian Aboriginal teens live in the wilderness for six months or so—leads to the threshold of the new identity or life. In the case of Walkabout, the liminal space leads adolescent boys to the threshold of manhood itself.</p> <p>The concept of liminality was broadened in the 1960s by British anthropologist Victor Turner, who described a state of limbo replete with ambiguity, where things once held as certain were thrown into doubt. In that wider sense, we all know the liminal well: The questing that comes with puberty, for instance, or the period of chaos that ensues when a government is overthrown. When we enter the liminal zone, our identity is held in suspension. The neophyte in that space has no family, property, or even identity—all the better to be transformed, Turner said.</p> <p>Now it is time to broaden the definition of the liminal again. Some of our new liminality comes from the rise of the global citizen, whose work and lifestyle takes them from culture to culture in service of multinational corporations, governments, and nonprofits aiding the developing world. With economies slowing in the West and heating up in places like Turkey, China, India, and Brazil, workers can expect to leave their culture of origin for foreign lands. That includes Americans themselves. American Wave, using data from a recent Zogby Poll, found that 0.8 percent of households had planned to relocate abroad in 2009; by 2011, the number had soared to 2.5 percent, or 7.5 million people. </p> <p>One need not be a global traveler to inhabit the in-between. Our move across borders and into the liminal state has soared, thanks to social forces from economic and workplace upheaval. Even as the economy in the United States recovers, work itself has become increasingly insecure. More than 42 million Americans, about a third of the workforce, are currently freelancers, consultants, independent contractors, or otherwise self-employed. The new workplace is a space between a prior short-term gig and that phantasm known as a fulltime job.</p> <p> </p> <p><span class="dropcap">U</span>ntil recently, the scientific study of personal transition has focused on the interlude: The honeymoon after a wedding, the summer between high school and college, the time between jobs. But as transitional spaces and periods have expanded to include so much more of our lives, the nature of inquiry has changed: Now researchers want to know what happens when liminality lasts months, years, even a lifetime.</p> <p>One thread of research comes from anthropologists studying so-called “global nomads,” who spend childhood abroad and as adults often live and work across borders themselves. Neither fully part of the old culture nor totally immersed in the new, they achieve something else—what researchers call a “thirdness”—in which the cultures merge. Modern nomads can live between three cultures, four cultures, and more.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The new workplace is a space between a prior short-term gig and that phantasm known as a fulltime job.</p> </blockquote><p> </p> <p>No matter what their era and region of the world, nomads have always shared certain traits: The most enduring could be the need to travel light. Archaeologist Steve Rosen of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel, has studied prehistoric nomadic societies between 4,000 and 1,000 B.C. Unlike settled communities, which collected possessions and generated refuse at a significant pace, the nomads who stayed put for just a couple of months accumulated very little. Without land ownership, the nomads were free to pick up and leave, only limited by the seasonal availability of resources.</p> <p>The impulse to shed possessions continues today. Fleura Bardhi, professor of marketing at the Cass Business School, City University of London, who studies mobility and globalization, showed that unlike immigrants of old, the new global nomads don’t much care for possessions reminding them of home. To track their culture, she interviewed 35 transnational professionals, mostly global and regional managers who had relocated more than three times in a decade, and traveled at least 60 percent of the time. Such an individual might come from Sweden but live in Vietnam and travel throughout Southeast Asia for much of the year. All study participants chose the lifestyle and 15 were what Bardhi calls completely “deterritorialized”—they did not even have a specific home. “Our participants could not live without mobility,” she says, because they craved experience, not things.</p> <p>Unlike the immigrant group, possessions did not define who they were. Instead, Bardhi’s subjects quickly detached from one life by embedding themselves in the liminal space, discarding possessions and even friends before moving on. One person in the study had lived in 12 countries over the course of nine years and only moved what could fit in carry-on luggage. The rest was discarded and purchased new in every new place. Another individual threw out good-bye gifts from colleagues. Like real-life versions of the fictional characters in <i>Up in the Air</i>, married participants eschewed possessions in their transient lives; one couple coordinated calendars and met at airports whenever they could. “They found learning new languages and working with different people on different projects in different places a great way to develop,” Bardhi says. The travelers were happily at home in the liminal world.</p> <p>Cultural anthropologist D’Andrea, today an advertising executive taking the pulse of the global crowd, has likewise discovered modern nomads at home in the state of transition. While pursuing his Ph.D. at The University of Chicago, D’Andrea spent years studying a group of artisans, therapists, and “neo-hippies” who traveled back and forth between the community of Ibiza Island, Spain, and Goa, India. Members of this digital, techno music-loving international crowd embraced the goal of personal transformation, and they were always on the move. By moving “across spaces and within themselves,” D’Andrea says, they “embraced the global as a new reference point and home.”</p> <p>D’Andrea’s nomads had an Einsteinian perception of relativity—a sense of placement in the displacement of their new, globalized world. “It was a new way to see the relative nature of culture and identity, one that is noticed by means of movement,” he explains. By wandering from place to place, the people he studied were able to see life through new eyes and ultimately question values their culture of origin espoused. The liminal experience of hypermobility was the key existential state around which they formed their identities. They chose freedom and autonomy over possessions. They valued change over stability. Once they started wandering, their lives and relationships changed. Those who came to Ibiza as a couple, for instance, transformed so much they often broke up after living there. The nomadic life has “a disruptive impact on individuals and invites experimentation,” says D’Andrea. “The consequence is that old interests and partners may not look as attractive as before.”</p> <p>While the traditional immigrant might hope to fit in, D’Andrea’s group of expressive nomads decisively “rejected their own homelands” and the ethnocentric cultures they spawned. Detached from constraints in their liminal space, they sought “any practice that allowed for exploration of their personal capabilities in creative, pleasurable, and transcendent ways.”</p> <p> </p> <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>’Andrea’s neo-hippies and Bardhi’s globetrotters represent the rest of us less in numbers than in universal traits: the desire and ability to learn and grow. “Global nomads are a window into the future of trends on the rise that change people,” says D’Andrea. At the same time, they point to the displacement and insecurity that haunt the liminal world.</p> <p>It’s no surprise, then, with the rise of the liminal have emerged special guides, people deft at telling us how to navigate the ambiguous spaces between the lines. Sheila Ramsey, a consultant who works in global leadership development, has spent years helping businesses navigate across cultures, especially the colossal gap between East and West. The experience, she says, enhances intuition. Ramsey offers the example of Americans traveling to Japan. While Americans are straightforward, focused on getting tasks done, Japanese move forward only by navigating the backstory and attending to the feelings of colleagues and friends. To navigate the chasm, “Americans must step back, slow down, and rely on intuition,” Ramsey says. Without your native compass, sometimes only a sixth sense can be your guide.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Like real-life versions of the fictional characters in <span>Up in the Air</span>, married participants eschewed possessions in their transient lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barbara F. Schaetti, a specialist in intercultural communication who works with Ramsey in helping global nomads adapt, offers an example of an engineering class given pipe cleaners to build a toy bridge. Half the class was shown examples of bridges that had worked in the past. The other half was shown nothing. Time after time, the group shown nothing—the group left to wander the liminal unknown—designed the best bridge. “They are wide open to all possibilities and can get out of their own way,” Schaetti says.</p> <p>That wisdom is not lost on Maggi Savin-Baden of Coventry University in the United Kingdom. “The liminal state has become chronic,” she says.</p> <p>Director of research at Coventry’s Disruptive Media Learning Lab, Savin-Baden has found we are serial learners. And serial zones of transition—liminal zones set off from the workaday world—are especially effective in helping us think critically. Indeed, she says, we need to immerse in liminal space to master the knowledge most useful to our postmodern world of creative destruction and constant change—so called “troublesome knowledge” that appears, at first, to be alien, counterintuitive, and incoherent, making no logical sense. Learners need to fail first to make breakthroughs, says Savin-Baden, who creates liminal zones in cyberspace, such as the virtual world <i>Second Life</i>, to help her students. “There is a sense of knowing the world differently there, because you are living and working through change,” she says.</p> <p>In the end, say the scientists, we might as well reap the benefits of our chronically liminal state, because there is no going back. We live in a global society powered by constant change. Long stints of transition are here to stay. They form the breadcrumb path to the future. If we can find some peace in the interstices, we can attain troublesome knowledge, reinvent our lives, and deftly find our way home.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Pamela Weintraub is consulting executive editor at </i>Discover <i>and a freelance writer living in Brooklyn.

            <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur cultural history is crumbling. Not because of bad education—though one might make that argument—but because of chemistry. </p> <p>Between the late 60s and the late 80s, much of our culture—from the Nixon trials on television to unreleased music from famous artists like the Beatles—was recorded on magnetic tape, and this tape is starting to disintegrate. Some of the audio and visual data has already been safely adapted to digital storage, but the majority hasn’t—and it’s a problem of massive proportions.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="Caught on tape" data-capper="Richard Nixon after his resignation as 37th President of the United States." data-credits="Gene Forte/Contributor"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7567_90ef635b07e4335585e9aa6c7d742e94.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Caught on tape:</strong> Richard Nixon after his resignation as 37th President of the United States.</span><span class="credit">Gene Forte/Contributor</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/documents/storage14/Breitung_20140919_Tape_Storage_Arch_Mtg.pdf" target="_blank">Cultural Heritage Index</a> estimates that there are 46 million magnetic tapes in museums and archives in the U.S. alone—and about 40 percent of them are of unknown quality. (The remaining 60 percent are known to be either already disintegrated or in good enough condition to be played.)  </p> <p>What’s more, in only about 20 years we won’t be able to digitize them, according to audio and video preservationist George Blood, in Philadelphia. This is partly because digitization machines that can handle the tapes have ceased production. On Sept 30th, for example, Sony stopped taking orders for videotape machines, and in June 2015, the last audio reel-to-reel machine went out of production. Plus, the ones that already exist are wearing down—and parts to repair them are difficult to come by. And to add to this, the tapes themselves are degrading. Trying to digitally process these in studio-grade machines, for example, clogs the tape player heads, wrecking the very machinery that can digitize the tapes as stocks of them are dwindling.</p> <p>The cause of tape disintegration is something called sticky shed syndrome, a result of the hydrolysis of esters. When ester, a compound that partly constitutes the polyurethane binder that holds a tape’s magnetic particles, combines with water, they form a carboxylic acid plus alcohol. The acid and alcohol make the tapes sticky and unplayable. This means that tapes stored in damp, humid climates—like so many of the unplayable 1960s jazz tapes filling attics in the South—are especially prone to disintegration. Audio engineers know the sound of sticky shed right away: The tapes squeak and squeal across the players. </p> <p>Sticky shed tapes are not lost to the world forever, however. They can be baked in a low-temperature oven (about 100 degrees F) for eight hours or more. This often drains the water from the tape and can make it playable for a short while. However, baking tapes also makes them precariously brittle—so treating tapes of unknown quality isn’t a good idea. </p> <p>But letting these tapes just disintegrate would be akin to idly watching millions of books fall into a pit of fire. So Steve Morgan, an analytical chemist at the University of South Carolina, and Eric Breitung, a senior research scientist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, decided to help prevent that outcome. Since batches of tapes stored in the same conditions could be degrading at different rates—due to the different manufacturing techniques and materials used throughout the years by different brands—Morgan and Breitung needed a way to figure out which tapes are degrading the fastest to prioritize the arduous digitization efforts. </p> <p>Before them, other researchers had employed infrared spectroscopy, a non-invasive technique, to assess the damage. It works by identifying various light absorption peaks, corresponding to changes in ester, carboxylic acid, and alcohol content—each absorbs light differently. However, this approach wasn’t totally reliable: Not only were the peaks not very different between playable and nonplayable tapes, making the level of degradation difficult to determine, but the sound engineers also had difficulty working with the tool. </p> <p>To overcome these hurdles, they combined a laptop-sized infrared spectrometer with an algorithm that uses multivariate statistics to pick up patterns of all the absorption peaks (this kind of analysis is called chemometrics). As the tapes go through the breakdown reaction, the chemical changes give off tiny signals in the form of compounds, which can be seen with infrared light—and when the patterns of reactions are analyzed with the model, it can predict which tapes are playable. The sound engineers could use this, says Breitung. “We couldn’t have them analyzing spectra—it would take too long and the types of changes were too subtle.” Taking spectra samples at 20 different places along the tape, the researchers get a pretty good sense of the tape’s condition. </p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Letting these tapes just disintegrate would be akin to idly watching millions of books fall into a pit of fire</p>
</blockquote> <p>With their new device, they started surveying cultural institutions around the U.S. to find the most rapidly degrading tapes, and it turned out that the quarter-inch audiotape—first used in 1972—was the type of media that the institutions were most worried about saving.</p> <p>In a test of 133 quarter-inch audiotapes belonging to the Library of Congress, containing various media, the researchers identified which ones were unplayable with 92 percent accuracy. They confirmed the results by listening to them. A report on the new tool and the researchers’ findings was published in August in the journal <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01810" target="_blank"><i>Analytical Chemistry</i></a><i>.</i> </p> <p>Tape also isn’t the only aging media in museum collections. For Gene DeAnna, head of the Library of Congress’s Recorded Sound Section, it’s the worsening state of lacquer discs that keeps him up at night. The problem with lacquer discs, which were used to record sound in the 1930s, first by movie studios and then by radio stations, is basically the same with magnetic tape. Even “if they are properly stored,” says DeAnna, “they start to break down.”</p> <p>One batch of lacquer discs that has records of radio dispatches from World War II has been particularly challenging to digitize. Many radio stations had switched to using discs manufactured with a glass base instead of the typical aluminum base, since aluminum was in demand for the war effort. Glass discs are even more fragile. But a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with the help of some students, developed a machine to record the dispatches without having to touch the discs. Called <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/2008/01/play-it-again-irene" target="_blank">IRENE</a>—an acronym for Image Recover Erase Noise, Etc.—it takes a high-resolution digital image of the disc using a beam of light and translates it into a digital file. </p> <p>DeAnna thinks this technology could transform the science of archives. Instead of making a copy of an original, and then a copy of that copy—and losing a bit of fidelity each time—IRENE offers the possibility of capturing the audio in its original state. </p><p>As opposed to making a copy and having the quality decrease, says DeAnna, “for the first time audio archivists can start thinking about preserving the object as an image of the grooves.” </p><p><br/></p><p><i><a href="http://katharinegammon.com/" target="_blank">Katharine Gammon</a> is a freelance science writer based in Santa Monica, Calif. who writes for </i>Discover, Wired,<i> and other outlets. <a href="https://twitter.com/kategammon" target="_blank">@kategammon</a></i></p><p><br/></p>

            <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>our-year old Simon is lost. His mother was in front of him just a moment ago, standing right there next to the grocery-store pyramid of apples, but now she’s gone. He looks past the lemons, the pears, the bananas, but still can’t see her. “Mom?” he cries, hoping she’ll come to his rescue. “Mom? Mom!” </p> <p>His mother, a few paces ahead, hears his call. Her ears perk up. “Simon?” </p> <p>He shouts back. “Mom!” Following his voice, she circles back around to find him.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits="Paul McGee/Getty Images"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7557_977f6f5f8bd5054b7ec5f72374d5e68d.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Paul McGee/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><span>This grocery-store scene could take place at a park, a zoo, a mall, or almost anywhere else. But it also occurs outside our human realm. In the ocean, bottlenose dolphins and calves whistle to call each other when they’re out of visual contact: Mom calls Junior using his signature whistle, and he echoes it back in acknowledgement. In the Venezuelan jungle, when green-rumped parrotlets and their offspring get separated, they do the same thing as the dolphins.</span></p> <p>While numerous species use signals of one kind or another to communicate—vervet monkeys, for example, make alarm calls to warn about predators, and honey bees use a complicated dance to describe food location and quality—these sorts of messages are innate. Parrotlets, dolphins, and humans on the other hand, actually create their own signature handles—they’re not inborn. “We don’t find this much in other animals,” says Vincent Janik, a biology professor at St. Andrews University. “We have very few examples of learned signals invented for a purpose.” </p> <p>That purpose, as far as researchers can tell, is to manage animals’ social relationships. Invented, name-like cries occur very rarely in the animal kingdom—yet, remarkably, the creatures that use them are incredibly different from each other. Then again, given that names, and the relationships they help to forge, are the foundation of an individual’s social world, it isn’t surprising that these three unrelated species independently developed them. </p> <p>For those animals that use them, names play into pretty much every stage of relationship building, from mating to cooperation to higher levels of group dynamics. It starts with an introduction, usually an exchanging of personal labels. Parrotlets offer their signature call when meeting a new peer, dolphins broadcast their signature whistles when passing or joining another group at sea, and humans—typically with a handshake or other gesture—introduce themselves with their respective monikers. For humans, sharing a name establishes initial rapport, and many people report <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/career-coach-the-power-of-using-a-name/2014/01/10/8ca03da0-787e-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html" target="_blank">feeling closer</a> to someone who refers to them by name in a conversation, thereby setting the stage for a friendship or a business relationship.</p> <p>Personal labels can also convey important social information: Just as human children typically bear their parents’ last name, some dolphin calves adopt whistles that are like their mother’s, and <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/07/07/rspb.2011.0932.full" target="_blank">parrotlet calls within a family are similar</a>. “Parrots provide a number of contact calls, and those of the youngsters’ tend to be modified versions of calls their parents make,” says Jack W. Bradbury, professor emeritus at Cornell University. The main determinant of their vocal repertoire appears to be upbringing: Fostered parrotlets will adopt calls like their adopted parents’ rather than their genetic ones. “Birds are as close as you get to <i>tabula rasa</i> in nature,” says Bradbury. They’re born with nearly blank slates and adapt quickly to their environment; the signature calls they develop are a reflection of that flexible identity.</p> <p>Unlike human names, which aren’t usually unique, parrotlet and dolphin signature calls typically are. “Every call is different, which suggests there is no additional meaning except to signal, ‘This is my identity,’” says Janik. On the other hand, there are almost 45,000 humans named John Smith in the US alone—so we need additional information, like social context or that person’s voice, to figure out who they are. </p> <p>Sometimes these signature handles change, and that can reflect changes in relationships. For parrotlets, morphing calls are a form of social negotiation, says Bradbury. He and his team discovered that, at first meeting, the birds exchange their signature calls several times. As their relationship unfolds, the similarity of their signals oscillates depending on whether their respective social groups will fuse and, in the event of a fusion, the group’s pecking order. </p> <p>Name morphing can also indicate animals’ closeness. Take dolphins, for example. “When males form alliances [and] spend all their time with each other, they make their whistles more alike,” Janik says. “They have their own signature whistles, but they become more similar to each other over time.” When humans become close, they may address one another by nicknames (Johnny for Jonathan, Cat for Catherine). Janik says the morphed calls could also be a way of signaling to others that these two individuals have each other’s back. Like teens that adopt a clique name (the Pink Ladies, the Plastics), a shared handle indicates an alliance. “If there’s another dolphin trying to attack or taking female away, two similar whistles could make it immediately clear that these two could cooperate for resource defense,” explains Janik. Forming and identifying close alliances is an important part of navigating the social landscape (just think back to middle school), so the ability to relay this information through signature calls is an advantage in setting up, and thriving in, a complex social world. </p> <p>But humans’ use of names set us apart from the others in one important way: We use them to talk about people when they’re not present. There are many recorded instances of captive <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/05/12/birdbrain" target="_blank">parrots</a> and <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/com/98/1/10/" target="_blank">dolphins</a> learning new words, so researchers know that they’re capable of using sounds that represent objects they can’t see, but they’ve never observed wild animals using <i>names</i> to talk about others they can’t see.</p><p>Such differences can provide clues about our background. The evolutionary history of communication leaves no fossil record, so studying how other animals invent and use names is the closest we can get. Comparing other animal societies’ behavior to our own can shed light on the mix of animal intelligence and environmental pressures that allowed certain species to create names. As scientists continue to decode animals’ vocalizations, we’ll be learning not only about their social worlds, but perhaps our own as well.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Jane C.

            <p><span class="dropcap">A</span> 21-year-old named Boyan Slat says he can solve one of the greatest ecological disasters of our age: the build-up of vast amounts of plastic in our oceans. The young Dutchman, often photographed in a t-shirt and shorts, says he’s designed a structure that will harvest and recycle much of that waste.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="" data-title="Gobbler of Plastic" data-capper="Artistic conception of Slat's array." data-credits="Erwin Zwart/The Ocean Cleanup"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7544_f81398ac7249eab440df0219892f3dd5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Gobbler of Plastic:</strong> Artistic conception of Slat’s array.</span><span class="credit">Erwin Zwart/The Ocean Cleanup</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Made from a combination of steel and polyester, Slat’s plastic-collecting structure floats on the surface of the ocean near the center of a gyre, a system of rotating ocean currents created by wind and the Earth’s rotation. There are six major gyres in the world’s oceans and, when plastic approaches one, it gets trapped by the churning currents and accumulates, over time forming large garbage patches. Slat’s array faces the current, letting it do the work of pushing plastic into the array’s arms. It’s V-shape structure—composed of long connecting booms that stretch for 100 kilometers (60 miles) each and anchored to the seabed every 4 kilometers with long polyester straps—encourages plastic to flow toward its center, where a solar-powered conveyer belt extracts, separates, and stores the plastic in a tower for pickup. </p> <p>Slat has captured the imagination of both scientists and investors worldwide—but he’s also riled critics who argue he’s in over his head. Oceanographers Kim Martini and Miriam Goldstein, for example, reviewed Slat’s project in 2014 and <a href="http://www.deepseanews.com/2014/07/the-ocean-cleanup-part-2-technical-review-of-the-feasibility-study/" target="_blank">faulted</a> it for relying too much on average versus extreme measurements of the ocean, and for not having a workable solution for biofouling, the corrosion of surfaces by barnacles, algae, and other microorganisms. This September, members of the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit group devoted to eliminating plastic pollution, argued that Slat’s model doesn’t account for organisms that passively float near the surface and can’t swim to escape the array, <a href="http://www.planetexperts.com/why-the-ocean-clean-up-project-wont-save-our-seas/" target="_blank">including</a> the purple janthina snail and the wind-driven velella velella jelly.</p> <p>“I didn’t have a clue about the forces we would have to deal with,” Slat concedes. But he sees this as an advantage. “I think the fact that I didn’t know a lot about off-shore engineering or oceanography actually helped me to put this forward, because if I hadn’t been that naïve, I probably would have dismissed the whole notion within a split second.” </p> <p><i>Nautilus</i> caught up with the young entrepreneur, engineer, and inventor this past August, when he and his team at <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/theoceancleanup.com" target="_blank">The Ocean Cleanup</a> were refining their design and getting ready to launch an expedition to gather data on the great Pacific Ocean garbage patch, which will tell them more about the feasibility of their project. Slat plans to install his first test model, a 2-kilometer structure, in the waters near Japan next year. He aims to have the 100-kilometer model collecting plastic in 2020; in five years’ time, he projects that almost half the plastic in the great Pacific Ocean patch will be removed by this single model. </p> <p>Slat’s voice is young, but confident. During our Skype conversation, he spoke earnestly about plastic pollution and his vision for eliminating it. He appears to have bypassed the “what am I going to do with my life?” angst that afflicts people in their early twenties.</p><p><br/></p> <p><b>How old were you when you realized you wanted to devote yourself to cleaning plastic from the oceans? </b></p> <p>When I was 16 and diving in Greece, I came across more plastic bags than fish. I then started to think about: Why can’t we clean it up? I quickly realized the ocean is quite big and so if you were to go out there with boats and nets, it would take basically forever. Then I had to do a high school science project, and for a year I used that time to figure out why it’s difficult to clean up. Eventually I realized that these [plastic] patches are rotating, and they don’t stay in one spot, which people told me is another reason why it couldn’t be done. But I thought: Well is that really a problem or could I also use that as a solution? Why move through the ocean if the ocean can move through you? </p> <p><b>How will you cover the cost of this large-scale cleanup?</b></p> <p>Right now we estimate that the cost to get it out of the water will be 4.5 euros per kilo based on the least amount of material in the water. But it’s really quite possible that there is 10 times as much plastic in the water, which would mean that the cost per kilo to get it out of the water would be divided by 10. So, it would only be 45 cents per kilo, which would of course be a world of difference. </p> <p><b>Are you also assuming that your operating costs will be lowered the more plastic you harvest and recycle?</b></p> <p>We’re assuming that. We’ve done tests with material. We got plastic from the Hawaiian shoreline, which we assume comes from the gyre, and that it’s the same quality of the stuff that we have in the middle of the ocean. It shows us we can make really high quality products out of this. And there have been over 30 companies that have shown interest in buying up the material, once we’ve taking it out of the ocean. </p> <p>Indeed the more kilos there will be, the cost per kilo will be less, and the less of a premium will be required to pay for the material to cover the cost. Considering this huge uncertainty on the amount of the plastic in the ocean, as well as some uncertainty as to the cost of the execution, which we currently predict to be € 320 million, we cannot make any prediction yet as to whether it will cover all of the costs, but it will certainly cover part of the costs.</p> <p><b>Will your structure be able to capture plastic smaller than 2 cm, which some claim makes up 98 percent of all ocean plastic?</b></p><p>This is incorrect. According to a 2014 <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111913" target="_blank">study</a> by Marcus Eriksen, of the 5 Gyres Institute, and colleagues, about 98 percent of the <i>mass</i> (not count) is in plastic larger than 5 mm. We’re currently using our scale model tests to better study how small a particle we can catch, but computer models show this is somewhere between 1 mm and 2 cm.</p> <p>If we were to wait [a few] more decades, then basically we wouldn’t have the time to put a stop to the breakdown into smaller stuff, thereby increasing the amount of micro plastics. And then we would a) have a serious ecological disaster and b) it will then be very difficult to get it out of the ocean again. So hence we really should urgently address this and develop the technologies required to get it out of the water. So, certainly there will be some minute particles that will go underneath it, but we shouldn’t live under the illusion that we will get every last piece of plastic out of the ocean. Really the goal is to get as much of the material out of there for as little budget as possible. </p> <p><b>Detractors have said that your design is too fragile, and it won’t be able to withstand the force of huge ocean waves. </b></p> <p>The whole design philosophy has been to move with the waves rather than try to fight them. If you try to fight them, you will most certainly lose. We just made a way to make the barrier and the moorings extremely flexible so they can follow the waves almost like an inverted pendulum, and thereby the loads aren’t being transferred to the moorings.  We calculate that there are about 200 tons per 4 kilometers, so it’s really within the boundaries of what materials and cables can do.</p> <p><b>Will your structure harm sea creatures, such as zooplankton, by getting caught with the plastic in the centrifuge, as some have alleged?</b></p> <p>This will be tested with real life examples, which is what we will be doing in Japan, but there is no reason to assume that it will result in any problems. Our prediction is that fish will be able to swim underneath it and plankton will be taken by the current, because they are negatively buoyant, meaning that there’s no reason to assume that they will get trapped.</p> <p><b>How will you keep living organisms from attaching to the structure or biting it, without also harming them?</b></p> <p>Biofouling is something we are looking at, and we’re actually doing tests with coatings. They are nontoxic coatings, which should be able to mitigate that problem. If that wouldn’t solve it, there is the rate at which the biofouling occurs. It’s so slow. It peaks at about a few 10 kilos per square meter. That’s nowhere near the buoyancy of these barriers. In other words, it’s really not a concern for us, but still we are looking into it. </p> <p><b>Do you think innovative cleanup projects ultimately encourage people to be litterbugs? </b></p> <p>If the fate of the oceans were to rely on the individual actions of 7.2 billion people, I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night. I really think we should use our technological ingenuity to our advantage here. But obviously it’s a combination of both preventing more stuff from entering the ocean and cleaning up what’s already out there. </p> <p>I don’t think there really is a debate. Actually I think they highly complement each other. Because we are communicating what we are doing now, hundreds of millions of people know about this problem.</p> <p>It’s very uninspiring thing to say that “since we can’t clean it up, the best thing to do is not make it worse.” If that really were the case, I don’t know I’d be that motivated to work on this problem. Having the prospect of a future that’s better than the present, instead of just not worse than the present, I think that’s an incredibly powerful way to get people involved in this.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Regan Penaluna is an assistant editor at </i>Nautilus.</p><p><br/></p>

</center> <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n 2003, author James Frey published a bestselling autobiographical memoir, <i>A Million Little Pieces</i>, purportedly detailing his struggle to overcome addiction. Nearly three years later, during a riveting appearance on <i>Oprah</i>, he admitted that several supposedly factual details had been embellished or fabricated. All later editions of the book included a note from Frey, admitting his embellishments but claiming that his primary mistake had been “writing about the person I created in my mind to help me cope, and not the person who went through the experience.”</p> <p>It was an interesting choice of words, given the role story plays in personal identity. Deep down, we are all raconteurs, drawing on past memories and weaving them into a coherent narrative to construct our autobiographical selves. “The story metaphor fits lives,” says Dan McAdams, a psychologist at Northwestern University who specializes in the autobiographical self. “It has a beginning, middle, and end. It has characters with times and scenes. That is how life is, and that is how people see life.”</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Ouellette_BR" data-title="%u201CThe Boyhood of Raleigh%u201D" data-capper="by John Everett Millais" data-credits="1870.

By the age of two, most of us can recognize ourselves in mirrors and understand how we fit in with relation to others. At this point, we are <i>actors</i> in our personal narratives, defining ourselves by explicit traits and the roles we play. We might be shy and conscientious students, while others are funny, outgoing, and popular.</p> <p>Around the age of 8, we add another layer: the self as <i>agent</i>. Now, in addition to being actors in our own lives, we also perceive our own agency: We can look at our past, project into the future, and set goals, whether we want to become an astronaut, a writer, or merely find a best friend. Finally, as we move into early adulthood, we embrace the self as <i>author</i>, developing a narrative identity that we continue to hone for the rest of our lives to describe what kind of actors we are, and why, as agents, we do what we do.</p> <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Bush evinces a classic redemptive narrative, achieving sobriety and literally redeeming himself by becoming an evangelical Christian. This gave him motivation to impose his own narrative on the rest of the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>His conclusions are based on hundreds of personal life story interviews, conducted over many years, with adults from all walks of life. The entire process lasts two hours. The interviews are recorded and transcribed, and McAdams works from the written transcripts. The subjects are asked to imagine their lives as a book, with chapters, just like a novel. </p> <p>Then McAdams asks them to focus on key scenes: a high point, a low point, a turning point, a negative early memory, a positive early memory, and so on—all universal elements to a good narrative. The broad strokes are the same: We all experience many such moments over the course of our lives, and we weave them into our story as it evolves.</p> <p>Next, McAdams asks the subject to identify those people who have filled the roles of heroes and villains. Subjects are also asked to think about future chapters—goals and aspirations—and how their values and beliefs are reflected in the full arc of the personal narrative.</p> <p>Finally McAdams asks subjects to identify overarching themes running through their stories. One common theme is redemption, particularly among people he calls “highly generative”—those who volunteer in soup kitchens or political campaigns, start their own non-profit charity, or otherwise seek to make a positive impact on the world. Their stories invariably involve hardship and suffering, but with an optimistic twist: They triumphed over their woes, learned valuable life lessons from the pain, and emerged stronger for it.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean that non-highly generative people are necessarily worse storytellers; their stories just don’t have highly redemptive themes. It requires a lot of hard work to be a generative person—how much easier would be to just stay home and watch <i>American Idol</i>?<i>—</i>and McAdams thinks that having a strong redemptive narrative serves as a motivational tool.</p> <p>That certainly seems to be the case for former U.S. President George W. Bush. In 2011, McAdams published the first comprehensive psychological profile of the former president in <i>George W. Bush and the Redemptive Dream—</i>a tricky task, particularly for such a politically polarizing figure. Bush evinces a classic redemptive narrative, achieving sobriety and literally redeeming himself by becoming an evangelical Christian, according to McAdams, who argues that this gave him a powerful motivation for trying to impose his own narrative on the rest of the country. (McAdams gave an lecture on the Bush profile <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEv2D6PTwsA" target="_blank">that is on YouTube</a>.) Frey, too, adopted a redemptive theme in <i>A Million Little Pieces</i>.</p> <p>In the end, of course, all stories are ultimately about change. Nobody tells a story about how they’ve always been the same. Therein lies the psychological power of narrative. We can change our stories, thereby changing ourselves, even though our core self remains the same.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>This article originally appeared on our blog, <a href="http://nautil.us/blog" target="_blank">Facts So Romantic</a>, in May 2013.</i><br/></p>

            <p><span class="dropcap mqw">M</span>y wife Ingrid and I had been in Aburi, Ghana for just over a week when our host, Kwame Obeng, informed me that I’d be joining the royal drummers for a performance at the chief’s palace the following afternoon, in celebration of an important holy day.</p> <p>It’s not as if I was unprepared. I’d first met Obeng three years earlier, when he came to Toronto to coach a drumming troupe made up of Ghanaian immigrants and a lone Westerner (myself). We became close: Obeng called me <i>mi nua</i>, or “my brother,” in Twi, the language of his ethnic group, the Akan. And when his visa expired after a year, he invited me to continue studying with him back home in Aburi, a small town nestled in the verdant Akuapem Hills. Two years later, I took him up on his invitation. And now it was time to show him what I could do. What happened next was a complete surprise to me. I would never find out if it was a surprise to Obeng.</p> <p>The day of the performance, Obeng stationed me and his nephew, a young man named Kwame Antwi, at a pair of enormous, barrel-shaped <i>bommaa</i> drums standing side by side. Each <i>bommaa</i> was carved from a 5-foot length of hollowed-out tree trunk, and both were painted a lustrous black and wrapped in red velvet fastened with brass studs. Just in front of us and to our left, Obeng himself stood before a pair of massive, goblet-shaped <i>atumpan</i> drums with antelope-skin heads. Directly behind us, a quartet of young boys and middle-aged men played three smaller drums and an iron bell. They were the rhythm section, while the two Kwames and I formed the front line.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>I had no choice but to soldier on at the drums. While I did, I also struggled to comprehend what was happening.</p> </blockquote><p><span>As the performance began, Kwame Antwi and I began bashing away at the thick cowhide heads with long, L-shaped sticks fashioned from tree branches. We made quite a pair: him long and lean and dark, me short and soft and very, very white. The raised platform at the opposite end of the courtyard gradually filled with chiefs and palace officials draped in togas and dresses, all in different colors: turquoise, scarlet, cobalt, maroon. There was very little chitchat. Instead, our audience listened in silence as we played the drums, and various notables got up to make speeches and offer prayers to their ancestors.</span><br/></p> <p>The rhythms played on the big <i>bommaa</i> drums consist of several sets of patterns that are executed in unison by both drummers, each one longer and more complicated than the last. At first, I was able to match Antwi stroke for stroke. But as we moved into the longer and more complex material, things went completely off the rails. Suddenly, Antwi seemed to be adding rhythms that I’d never heard before. I tried to keep up with him, to imitate his hand movements even if I couldn’t quite make out what he was playing.</p> <p>But I couldn’t. Standing there in front of the assembled royals, the truth slowly dawned on me: The rhythms I was supposed to play in public in Aburi were not the same as the ones that Obeng had taught me in Toronto, and which he had repeated for Ingrid and me during a brief private lesson just the previous day. Instead, they included swathes of material that were radically different from anything he’d shown us thus far; so different that I couldn’t figure them out, let alone execute them, in the heat of the moment. But no one else seemed willing to admit it.</p> <p>“Alex, what is wrong?” Antwi asked as the two of us sat down next to Ingrid during a break. “You played these yesterday, no problem.”</p> <p>“The rhythms are different,” I said, still in shock at having totally blown my public debut.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“These rhythms are different. They aren’t the ones I played in Toronto. They aren’t the ones we played with Obeng in our lesson yesterday.”</p> <p>“Of course they are the same,” said Antwi. “Only faster!”</p> <p>That would be the standard line from our Ghanaian friends for the next several months: The rhythms are the same, only faster! But they weren’t. As our hosts continued to insist that they had taught me the correct rhythms, I flubbed performance after performance: at rituals, at funerals, sometimes for enormous crowds. I couldn’t stop performing—we’d traveled thousands of miles to learn this music, and our presence in the ensemble was a source of prestige for Obeng—but the chiefs and palace officials who knew <i>fontomfrom</i> best must surely have realized that I was perpetually botching it, even if they were unfailingly polite, saying only “<i>woaye ade!</i>” (“well done!”) after every attempt.</p> <p>I had no choice but to soldier on at the drums. While I did, I also struggled to comprehend what was happening. Eventually I boiled it down to two choices: Either we had radically divergent ideas about what constituted musical sameness and difference, about what gave a piece of music its unique identity and aural signature; or Obeng was intentionally hiding the full rhythms from Ingrid and me for unknown reasons. Was it deception or mental disconnect?</p><p><img data-title="Keeping%20the%20beat" data-w="733" data-h="410" class="vimeo-breakers" src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/536974089_640.jpg" data-video-id="140441960" data-capper="The%20Aburi%20%3Ci%3EFontomfrom%3C/i%3E%20ensemble%20performs%20in%20the%20village%20of%20Akyimente%20in%20Ghana%20in%201997.%20To%20the%20rear%20of%20the%20ensemble%20are%2C%20from%20left%20to%20right%2C%20the%20%3Ci%3Edawuro%3C/i%3E%20or%20bell%3B%20a%20small%20goblet-shaped%20drum%20called%20%3Ci%3Eapaso%3C/i%3E%2C%20played%20with%20hand%20and%20stick%3B%20and%20two%20cylindrical%20drums%20known%20as%20%3Ci%3Emmeremma%3C/i%3E%2C%20played%20only%20with%20sticks.%20At%20the%20front%20of%20the%20ensemble%2C%20Kwame%20Obeng%20plays%20a%20pair%20of%20large%20goblet-shaped%20drums%20called%20%3Ci%3Eatumpan%3C/i%3E.%20To%20his%20right%20are%20two%20large%20cylindrical%20%3Ci%3Ebommaa%3C/i%3E%20drums.%20The%20%3Ci%3Ebommaa%3C/i%3E%20player%20immediately%20to%20Obeng%u2019s%20right%20is%20Kwame%20Antwi." data-credits=""/></p> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap mqw">M</span>y confusion—and my sudden incompetence—would not have been such a big deal if the style of music we were playing, called <i>fontomfrom</i>, were just background music, the Akan equivalent of cocktail piano. But it wasn’t. Every time chiefs appeared in public on official business, the royal drums came out. They were a vital element of regalia, a principal accoutrement of office. Perhaps even more importantly, the big <i>bommaa</i> and<i> atumpan</i> drums didn’t just make music for dancing. They talked. Literally.</p> <p>Twi is a tone language, like Mandarin Chinese: Each syllable has its own pitch, each word or phrase its own unique melody. Change those tones, alter those melodies, and the meaning of the words changes, too. Something as simple as asking a person’s name becomes an exercise in birdsong.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gelfand_BR-notes2" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7537_256bf8e6923a52fda8ddf7dc050a1148.png" alt=""/><figcaption><strong>MUSICAL SPEECH:</strong> The relative heights of the words in this Twi phrase represent different pitch levels. Taken together, they form a melody that can be imitated on a musical instrument.</figcaption></figure><p><span>By imitating the tones and rhythms of Twi, the Akan can “speak” with their musical instruments—their horns and trumpets, their drums and bells—almost as clearly as they do with their mouths. The </span><i>atumpan</i><span>, which produce two distinct pitches, are particularly well suited to this task; but the </span><i>bommaa </i><span>can do it, too. That was why the crowd at the palace had been so quiet: They were listening to what the drums had to say. The phenomenon, widespread in both West and Central Africa, is known as surrogate speech. It can add a layer of semantic depth to even the simplest music.</span><br/></p> <p>Every time that the chief, Nana Djan Kwasi, got up and walked around the courtyard, for instance, the two Kwames and I engaged in a little call-and-response.</p> <p>Kwame Obeng: <i>bom bom</i></p> <p>Kwame Antwi and me: <i>BRRM BRRM!</i></p> <p>The rhythmic phrase <i>bom bom BRRM BRRM</i>, <i>bom bom BRRM BRRM</i> had a nice beat to it, and could just have been pleasant filler, something to play while the chief moved from place to place. And on one level, it was. On another, though, it was an earnest plea from the principal talking drums in the ensemble: <i>Nana, bre bre! Nana, bre bre!</i> “Chief, slowly! Chief, carefully!” If a chief stumbles in public, it’s a sign of bad luck. So we were asking him to watch his step.</p> <p>The drums didn’t just speak to the living, but also to the dead: the revered ancestors who have left this earthly plane, yet continue to influence the affairs of their kin. The Akan believe that their ancestors are forever watching over them, and must forever be placated with prayers, offerings, and other remembrances. They also believe that their ancestors are particularly sensitive to the sound of the drums. That’s one of the reasons why Akan drummers normally take great care to avoid mistakes. You wouldn’t want to anger your ancestors by saying the wrong thing. In the old days, a sloppy royal drummer was likely to have an ear cut off. So when I butchered my part alongside Antwi that day at the palace, I wasn’t just making the group sound bad—I was sticking a wrench in the gears of a rich cultural system where speech, art, and religion are all intertwined. Little wonder my heart was pounding in my ears as I walked away from the drums, the echoes of my mistakes still ringing through the courtyard.</p> <p>This music was important. Why, then, did Obeng insist on withholding information that would have prevented us from blowing almost every performance we gave while we were in Ghana? Did he have some ulterior motive? Or was there some basic aspect of Akan music that rendered it opaque to us on a fundamental level—culturally, psychologically, or even neurologically?</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gelfand_BR-author" data-title="PROBLEMS%20IN%20THE%20CLASSROOM" data-capper="Kwame%20Obeng%20gives%20the%20author%20and%20his%20wife%20a%20lesson%20in%20%3Ci%3Ebommaa%3C/i%3E%20rhythms%20in%20Aburi." data-credits="Courtesy%20of%20Alexander%20Gelfand"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7543_a62178a8e59f8331e1cb4f057cbf0a55.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>PROBLEMS IN THE CLASSROOM:</strong> Kwame Obeng gives the author and his wife a lesson in <i>bommaa</i> rhythms in Aburi.</span><span class="credit">Courtesy of Alexander Gelfand</span></figcaption></figure> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>ngrid and I were both graduate students at the University of Illinois before we left for Ghana in the summer of 1997. I was a Ph.D. candidate in ethnomusicology, a kind of musical anthropology, and Ingrid was completing a doctorate in percussion. In other words, we weren’t exactly musical hacks. But the difficulty of <i>fontomfrom</i> was unexpected, and exceptional.</p> <p>Unlike the drumming that often accompanies African dance classes in the West, <i>fontomfrom </i>doesn’t have a particularly strong groove. But like most West African drumming, it does contain many different moving parts, from the long, complex patterns played on the <i>bommaa</i> and <i>atumpan</i> to the short, highly repetitive patterns played on the smaller drums and the iron bell. All of these rhythms interlock; often, they complete one another, the sounds of one drum filling in the silences of the others to produce unexpected patterns, like individual strands in a tapestry.</p> <p><i>Fontomfrom</i> rhythms can also be curiously ambiguous. For instance, you might think you’re playing a waltz (ONE two three, ONE two three), while the guy next to you sounds as if he’s playing a march (ONE two, ONE two). In fact, if you listen to him long enough, you might change your mind and decide that you, too, are really playing a march. In that sense, playing in a <i>fontomfrom</i> ensemble is like being inside a sonic version of an Escher lithograph: As you shift your attention from one part to another, the entire picture seems to change.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Attempting to decipher those brief, puzzling segments was like trying to catch a falling knife.</p> </blockquote><p><span>The </span><i>bommaa</i><span> patterns that I was suddenly expected to play in Ghana, however, were in a league of their own. Bits of them weren’t just rhythmically ambiguous; they were rhythmically dysfunctional. A musicologist would say they were ametric, or lacked a clear relationship to any kind of steady pulse whatsoever. But there was definitely some kind of logic to them, because whenever two drummers who actually knew what they were doing took over at the </span><i>bommaa</i><span>, they not only managed to play in perfect unison; they also coordinated their entrances and exits against the matrix of the other drummers’ parts with flawless consistency. Clearly, they knew—and heard—something we didn’t.</span><br/></p> <p>It didn’t help that Ingrid and I could barely hear the <i>bommaa r</i>hythms at all. While we were usually paired with an experienced court drummer in performance, we were also constantly being told to play “louder,” “faster,” and “with more force,” which only made it harder for us to make out the rhythms that our partners were playing (and easier for everyone else to hear our mistakes). Not that it would have been easy under other circumstances: It is hard to describe just how loud a <i>fontomfrom </i>ensemble is, with its clangorous iron bell, its piercing small drums, its booming <i>atumpan</i>, and its thunderous <i>bommaa</i>. To make matters worse, Nana Djan Kwasi’s palace courtyard was an enormous echo chamber. We taped every performance we gave at court, but the sound of the big drums ricocheting around the concrete walls and corrugated metal roof completely overloaded our microphones, turning all of our recordings into a howling mess.</p> <p>Toward the end of our stay, a friendly sub-chief at the court of Nana Djan Kwasi allowed us to record Obeng and the rest of the royal drummers under more controlled conditions in a nearby village. With the help of these tapes, Ingrid nearly got the rhythm down. She was able to sing long stretches of it under her breath as she listened along: “Da da, da da, da DA da da DA ...”</p> <p>“Hey, Al, it’s actually starting to make sense! “I can follow along with most of it now.”</p> <p>“Me, too,” I said. “But there are a few places where they still lose me.”</p> <p>“You mean like here?” Ingrid said, cueing up a segment of the tape for me.</p> <p>“Yeah,” I said, squinting slightly. “What the hell is that?”</p> <p>Western music has evolved in concert with its own notation system, so that Western musicians tend to hear what they can read, and read what they can hear. It did not evolve to reflect the rhythmic subtleties of <i>fontomfrom</i>. There were, we discovered, brief snippets of those <i>bommaa</i> rhythms that we could not notate accurately; as far as our musical system was concerned, they did not exist. Perhaps as a consequence, we couldn’t quite hear them, either: They sounded blurry, like figures in an Impressionist landscape. The problem was almost certainly not with our ears, but with our brains.</p> <p>Bill Thompson, a psychologist at Macquarie University in Australia who specializes in music perception and cognition (and whom I once served as a graduate assistant at York University in Toronto), suggests that we may have lacked a mental template, or schema, for categorizing these rhythms, and were therefore unable to perceive them clearly. “Rhythm is an interesting case,” Bill told me, “because my sense is that the capacity to ‘hear’ a particular rhythmic pattern is first and foremost equivalent to the ability to ‘predict’ what will come next at varying time spans.” In the absence of such a schema, Bill adds, “we cannot predict what will come next, and have the experience of ‘not being able to hear the rhythm.’ Of course we ‘hear’ the rhythm in a literal sense, but we just can’t predict the unfolding pattern.” The ethnomusicologist David Locke, a specialist in West African drumming at Tufts University, experienced something similar when studying a form of <i>fontomfrom</i> played by an ethnic group known as the Ga. Echoing Thompson, he believes that a “lack of organizing features of mind” can make it “hard to even perceive what the ears are receiving.”</p> <p>Whatever the reason, attempting to decipher those brief, puzzling segments was like trying to catch a falling knife. I can still remember the sense of shock I felt when I realized that I was experiencing the aural equivalent of a blind spot. It was as if a highly selective stroke had robbed me of the ability to read the letter Z or see the color purple. Those rhythms, some of them passing in the blink of an eye, were literally beyond my ken.</p> <p>So it may not have mattered whether Obeng had taught us everything we needed to know; I doubt we could have played it even if he had. But the question remained: Why didn’t Obeng <i>acknowledge </i>that the patterns he taught us in private were not the rhythms we were expected to play in public?</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gelfand_BR-notes1" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7534_cba2a355dc11678a805de3839a03e32d.png" alt=""/><figcaption><strong>AN ATUMPAN PHRASE:</strong> The Twi phrase, <i>Obren tenten kwa</i>, as it is played on the tuned <i>atumpan</i> drums. The drummed rhythm captures the number of syllables in the spoken phrase; the two pitches represent different tone levels (high and low); and the rolled “r” in <i>Obren</i> is mimicked through the use of sixteenth notes. <i>Obren tenten kwa</i> means “He is tall for nothing,” and refers to an 18th-century chief whose height did him little good in battle.</figcaption></figure><p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter some effort, Ingrid and I managed to persuade Kwame Antwi, my partner at the big <i>bommaa</i> drums, to teach us the extended patterns that we were supposed to play during public performances—the ones that Kwame Obeng refused to admit even existed, and that I couldn’t mimic, no matter how hard I tried. But the experience only left us more confused than ever. Rather than playing what we so dearly wanted to hear, or even running through what Ingrid called the “ridiculous baby-version” of the <i>bommaa</i> rhythms that Obeng insisted on showing us in our lessons, Antwi played yet another simplified variation of them. Antwi’s lesson-version was slightly more complicated than Obeng’s, but still nothing like the real deal. Yet when I said as much, Antwi steadfastly maintained his innocence.</p> <p>“Yes, it is the same,” he said.</p> <p>“It doesn’t sound the same. And it isn’t what Kwame Obeng shows us in our lessons with <i>him</i>, either,” I said.</p> <p>“Yes, they are the same!” he insisted.</p> <p><i>“The same as what?”</i> I wanted to scream.</p> <p>Maybe the problem was the surrogate speech function of <i>fontomfrom</i>. What if those elusive rhythms had no semantic content, so that Obeng and Antwi didn’t consider their absence (or presence) to constitute a meaningful difference? That might render the “lesson patterns” and the “performance patterns” equivalent to our teachers, even if they seemed like obviously distinct entities to us. Or perhaps the two Kwames evaluated musical identity according to some other criteria altogether—criteria that were as foreign to us as the mystery rhythms themselves.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>I thought that I’d been tapping out some harmless dance rhythms, when in fact I had been participating in a brief audio play about the ritual slaughter of children.</p> </blockquote><p><span>Desperate for insight, Ingrid and I turned to J.H.K. Nketia, a renowned ethnomusicologist who was then director of the International Center for African Music and Dance at the University of Ghana. Nketia was my hero: An Akan from the Ashanti region, he did fieldwork in Akuapem in the 1950s, and wrote the seminal work on Akan drumming. He didn’t so much as blink an eye when we told him about the simplified </span><i>bommaa</i><span> rhythms that Obeng and Antwi tried to pass off as the real thing in our lessons. But he did smile a bit.</span><br/></p> <p>“They may be simplified, but they are still the same,” he said.</p> <p>“Because they share certain rhythmic motifs?” Ingrid asked.</p> <p>“Yes, there is that. But not just that,” he said. “A piece consists of a number of different elements that lend it identity. If those elements are present, it is the same. If not, it is different. This is a concept you will have to struggle with.”</p> <p>But which elements make up a rhythm’s identity? When Obeng came to Toronto, he taught me and my fellow drummers both basic and alternate versions of the accompanying patterns played on the smaller instruments, spelling the differences out clearly. In Aburi, however, Obeng didn’t even acknowledge the differences between the basic <i>bommaa </i>rhythms we learned in our lessons—rhythms he had previously taught me in Toronto, and that I had performed at events in Canada and the United States—and the lengthier and more complex ones we were supposed to play in public. If I knew what Obeng was paying attention to in each example, maybe I could understand the stark differences between them. But I didn’t know, and maybe, given the sheer difficulty of recognizing <i>fontomfrom</i> rhythms to begin with, I couldn’t.</p> <p>Or, maybe our teachers were just screwing with us.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gelfand_BR-artwork" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7541_8900faaaf2290df7971ce903cd11ebda.png" alt=""/></figure> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap mqw">M</span>any African societies shroud their traditional lore in secrecy, and the guardians of those secrets—elders, priests, chiefs—often reveal them gradually, divulging them in bits and pieces as a person ascends through ever higher levels of trust. This can be because the information itself is inherently sensitive, and also because its esoteric nature lends power and prestige to those who possess it. “Studies of secrecy in Africa show that the content of a secret there is less important than the use of secrecy as a strategy,” the art historian Mary H. Nooter (now Mary Nooter Roberts) wrote in her book <i>Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals</i>. “Although the content of a secret may be guarded and concealed, the secret’s existence is often flaunted. To own secret knowledge, and to show that one does, is a form of power.”</p> <p>Could that describe how musical knowledge was treated in Akuapem? Perhaps Obeng was unwilling to teach us the missing rhythms because they constituted some kind of privileged information. And maybe their status as an open secret—one that he and the other court drummers would play in public, but that we were not allowed to learn in private—served to highlight his own authority, and our own status as neophytes.</p> <p>We had already experienced this dynamic of concealment and revelation first-hand. During our time together in Toronto, Obeng had never so much as mentioned to me that the smaller instruments in the <i>fontomfrom</i> “spoke” just like their larger cousins. Then, one day in Aburi, when Ingrid and I were at the palace helping Obeng move the <i>fontomfrom</i> drums around, he casually revealed what the iron bell and the three small drums were saying. It was a full-blown conversation:</p> <p><i>Wanko a wobeko.<br/> Woto, wobeto.<br/> Wawie moframma kum?<br/> Pren pren, pren pren.</i></p> <p>“You will go even if you don’t wish to go.”<br/> “You fall, you will fall.”<br/> “Have you killed the little children?”<br/> “Just now, just now.”</p> <p>“What does it mean?” Ingrid asked. “Why were they killing the children?”</p> <p>“It is about the old days, when the ancestors made ‘medicine,’ ” Obeng said. He went on to describe how human beings were once sacrificed at the palace, something I’d previously only read about in anthropological studies and historical texts. Needless to say, we were both taken aback—especially me. For several years, I thought that I’d been tapping out some harmless dance rhythms, when in fact I had been participating in a brief audio play about the ritual slaughter of children.</p> <p>I don’t know why Kwame Obeng chose that particular moment to enlighten us, but I doubt it was happenstance. Perhaps, unbeknownst to us, Ingrid and I had somehow demonstrated our worthiness.</p> <p>Another time, at a funeral, I asked Kwame Antwi if the small ornament that he and many others wore on the straps of their sandals meant anything.</p> <p>“Yes,” he said.</p> <p>“What?” I asked.</p> <p>“<i>Aburuburuw nkosua</i>,” he said. “It is the name of a bird’s egg.”</p> <p>“Is that some kind of proverb?”</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>“What does it mean?”</p> <p>“I do not know. We will have to ask Kwame Obeng.”</p> <p>So we did.</p> <p>Obeng responded in Twi: “If it is written, it is written; if it is God’s will, then it will happen.”</p> <p>I turned back to Antwi.<br/> “Does everyone know what these ornaments are called?” I asked.</p> <p>“Yes,” he said.</p> <p>“But do they know what it means?”</p> <p>“No. Very few know that; only those who move with the royals.”</p> <p>Antwi was Obeng’s nephew and his lieutenant in the palace ensemble. By any reasonable standard, he spent a lot of time moving with the royals. But even he didn’t know something as basic as the meaning of a proverb that was literally stuck to his feet most of the time.</p> <p>Did the missing complexities in the music represent my own mysterious proverb, something I had not yet earned the right to learn? Was this all part of the process, by which I could only demonstrate my worth by figuring out the music on my own? Or was Obeng reluctant to teach me the missing rhythms for other reasons, yet equally reluctant to explicitly turn me down?</p> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hat’s as far as I got. Eighteen years later, the reasons for Obeng’s behavior remain as inscrutable to me in hindsight as those puzzling <i>bommaa</i> rhythms proved to be when I first encountered them.</p> <p>And that is a lesson in itself.</p> <p>As a musician and an ethnomusicologist, I assumed that with enough time and effort, I’d eventually grok both the music and the musical behavior of our hosts. In a way, I had to believe this; doing so was central to my own sense of identity, as it probably would be to anyone doing fieldwork in cultural anthropology. Certainly, none of my mentors in graduate school had raised the possibility that I (or anyone else, for that matter) might be confronted by a group of people whose music and motives would prove so stubbornly resistant to analysis and explication. In this age of extreme interconnectedness, when once-remote lands are only a cheap flight or a webpage away, it is tempting to think that all barriers to cross-cultural understanding are gradually disappearing; that there are no longer such things as strangers, just people we have not yet Googled or seen on the Discovery Channel.</p> <p>This is an illusion. Make no mistake: There are plenty of people, living in plenty of places, who remain giant puzzles to us, cheap airfare or no. And that is by no means a bad thing. Quite the opposite—it is a testament to the range of human diversity, and to the limits of human understanding. My experiences in Aburi may have been frustrating, but I learned a lot. I no longer assume that all barriers to cross-cultural communication can be overcome. Nor do I assume that I can really, truly get into someone else’s head and see (or hear) the world as they do by sheer force of reason and will—including my own friends and family.</p> <p>For these reasons, and also for the sheer intensity of our time there—we witnessed animal sacrifice and spirit possession, encountered cultural riches and material poverty rarely seen in the West, and suffered radical culture shock of a sort neither of us had experienced before, and haven’t again since—Aburi still fills me with a sense of awe. And I know that Ingrid feels the same way. When we talk about the things that shaped us as individuals and as a couple, we always return to Ghana, and the mystery of those <i>bommaa </i>rhythms.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Alexander Gelfand is a freelance writer and recovering ethnomusicologist based in New York City.

            <p><span class="dropcap mqw">W</span>hile a doctoral student at Princeton University in 1957, studying under a founder of theoretical computer science, Raymond Smullyan would occasionally visit New York City. On one of these visits, he met a “very charming lady musician” and, on their first date, Smullyan, an incorrigible flirt, proceeded very logically—and sneakily.</p> <p>“Would you please do me a favor?” he asked her. “I am to make a statement. If the statement is true, would you give me your autograph?”</p> <p>Content to play along, she replied, “I don’t see why not.”</p> <p>“If the statement is false,” he went on, “you don’t give me your autograph.”</p> <p>“Alright …”</p> <p>His statement was: “You’ll give me neither your autograph nor a kiss.”</p> <p>It takes a moment, but the cleverness of Smullyan’s ploy eventually becomes clear.</p> <p>A truthful statement gets him her autograph, as they agreed. But Smullyan’s statement, supposing it’s true, leads to contradiction: It rules out giving an autograph. That makes Smullyan’s statement false. And if Smullyan’s statement is false, then the charming lady musician will give him <i>either</i> an autograph or a kiss. Now you see the trap: She has already agreed not to reward a false statement with an autograph.</p> <p>With logic, Smullyan turned a false statement into a kiss. (And into a beautiful romance: The two would eventually marry.)</p> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is this sort of logical playfulness that Smullyan loves, and that everyone seems to love him for. His books on the subjects of recreational math and logic, with titles like <i>What Is the Name of This Book?</i> and <i>To Mock a Mockingbird</i>, not only encouraged people to pursue careers in these topics but also changed how math and logic are taught. Over his near century of life, Smullyan, 96, became an accomplished pianist and magician, made fundamental contributions to modern logic, and wrote about Taoist philosophy and chess. “He is the undisputed master of logical puzzles,” Bruce Horowitz, one of his former Ph.D. students, has said.</p> <p>One mark of Smullyan’s legacy is the interest philosophers and logicians still have in his most difficult puzzle, known as the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever. The title was given by a philosopher of logic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a colleague of Smullyan’s named George Boolos, who—no slouch himself—adored logical challenges of any sort. He once tested himself by giving a lecture on Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem, “one of the most important results in modern logic,” using only single syllable words.</p> <p>The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever goes like this:</p> <p>Three gods A, B, and C are called, in some order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely <i>random</i> matter. Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for “yes” and “no” are “da” and “ja,” in some order. <i>You do not know which word means which.</i></p> <p>Always up for a challenge, I sat down on my couch, pen and paper in hand, confident I could conquer the puzzle in two hours tops. It seemed to me that all I had to do was start by coming up with three questions at once and then work out their consequences. I asked A, for example, whether B was True; asked B whether A was True; and asked C whether he was True. Hours later, having asked the gods every yes and no question I could think of, I understood how the puzzle got its name. Clearly my questions weren’t compelling the gods to answer the way I wanted them to.</p> <p>Frustrated, I went in search of enlightenment. The master atop the mountain turned out to be Boolos, who solved the puzzle in 1996. How he did it turns out to be one of the best lessons in logic and truth I have ever received. If you’d like to give the puzzle a try yourself, you can stop reading here. Good luck! If you succeed, you have my congrats. But if you don’t, come on back and you can go over Boolos’ solution with me below.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Gallagher_BR" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7532_aeecc5a9c646444f00978ed43e747a96.png" alt=""/><figcaption><span class="caption"><strong>Ye Gods:</strong> In the hardest logic puzzle ever, one must determine the true identities of gods named True, False, and Random.</span><span class="credit">De Agostini / Archivio J. Lange </span></figcaption></figure><p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he first thing Boolos tells us is you shouldn’t make the mistake of crafting your questions all at once, like I did, hoping that the assume-and-deduce strategy would pay off. Instead, the first thing you must do is figure out a question that will identify who<i> can’t</i> be Random—or who can <i>only</i> be either True or False. This will, by process of elimination, help you reveal the identity of Random. And once you’ve identified Random, it’s easy work exposing the other two.</p> <p>To better understand that approach, Boolos says, we need to see how it works in three simpler puzzles.</p> <p>The first simple puzzle is actually an iteration of Smullyan’s classic knights and knaves riddles, introduced in his book, <i>What Is the Name of This Book? </i>In the puzzles, knights always tell the truth, knaves always lie, and your task is to find out, based on what they say, who’s who.</p> <p>So for our first puzzle, suppose that you can’t remember whether Pluto is a dwarf planet, and you need to find out by asking someone nearby—but you don’t know whether that person is a knight or a knave. What’s the one yes-no question you can ask to figure out whether Pluto is a dwarf planet?</p> <p>As Boolos explains, you want to trap the knight or knave into giving you what you want. And you set that trap with the phrase <i>if and only if</i>—a logical construction called a “biconditional.” So in this case your question would be: “Are you a knight if and only if Pluto is a dwarf planet?”</p> <p>When you insert <i>if and only if </i>“between two statements that are either both true or both false, you get a statement that is true; but if you insert it between one true and one false statement, you get a false statement,” Boolos writes. It’s like a multiplication sign: Just as inserting a multiplication sign between either two positive or two negative numbers gets you a number that is always positive, inserting <i>if and only if </i>between either two true or two false statements gets you a statement that is always true.</p> <p>Given that you could be addressing your question to either a knight or knave, there are four possible responses (assuming we don’t know that Pluto is <i>in fact</i> a dwarf planet):</p> <p>1. If the person’s a knight and Pluto is a dwarf planet, then you get the answer “yes,” since both statements on each side of <i>if and only if</i> are true, and knights always speak truly.<br/><span>2. If the person’s a knight and Pluto is not a dwarf planet, you get “no,” since the question contains a false statement.<br/></span><span>3. If the person’s a knave and Pluto is a dwarf planet, you get “yes,” since knaves always speak falsely, and the correct answer is “no.”<br/></span><span>4. If the person’s a knave and Pluto is not a dwarf planet, you get “no,” since the correct answer is “yes.”</span></p> <p>Look what just happened: By phrasing the question using a biconditional, you get the information you want— if Pluto is a dwarf planet you get “yes” in response, and if it’s not you get “no”—whether you’re speaking to someone honest or not. However, remember that in the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever, the knight and knave—unlike in this example—don’t speak English.</p> <p>To trap them into giving away whether “da” and “ja” mean “yes” and “no” or vice versa, consider Boolos’ second simple puzzle.</p> <p>In this puzzle, you know you’re asking a knight—who always tells the truth—but he only responds with “da” and “ja.” What one yes-no question can you ask to figure out whether Pluto is a dwarf planet? Taking your lead from the last puzzle, you’ve got this: Ask the knight, “Does “da” mean “yes” if and only if Pluto is a dwarf planet?” Bingo: You get the answer “da” if Pluto is a dwarf planet and “ja” if not, even though we don’t know what those words mean. The result is as profitable as the one above: Not knowing whether the person was a knight or a knave wasn’t an obstacle, so neither is not knowing the meaning of “da” and “ja.”</p> <p>Boolos tells us that the Hardest Logical Puzzle Ever is essentially the first two simple puzzles plus a third. Before we solve that, though, take a look at how the first two puzzles combine: You need to find out whether Pluto is a dwarf planet, and you have to ask someone who could be either a knight or knave <i>and</i> he’ll only respond in “da” or “ja.” What question would you ask? If you think that, since this is a compound puzzle, the right thing to ask is a compound question, you’d be right! Ask: “Does “da” mean “yes” if and only if you’re a knight, and if and only if Pluto is a dwarf planet?” By asking this, you will get the answer “da” if Pluto is a dwarf planet and “ja” if it’s not, regardless of whether you’re addressing a knight or a knave. That well-crafted question is like a lock’s key.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Every statement is either true or false—there is no middle ground.</p> </blockquote><p><span>Now here’s the third simple puzzle. Its rules go like this. Suppose I place three cards in a row in front of you—two aces and a jack—face down. You don’t know how they’re ordered, but I do. By asking me one yes-no question, while pointing at one of the cards, you’ll be able to identify, with certainty, one of the cards as an ace. If you happen to point at one of the two aces, I’ll answer the question truthfully, like a knight; if you point at a jack instead, I’ll answer “yes” or “no” at random, like the Random god. Where will you point, and what will you ask?</span><br/></p> <p>This one may seem slightly trickier, but it’s really not. Point to any card and ask if one of the other cards is an ace. Let’s say you point to the middle card and ask whether the left card is an ace. “<i>Whether the middle card is an ace or not</i>,” says Boolos, “you are certain to find an ace by choosing the left card if you hear me say ‘yes’ and choosing the right card if you hear ‘no.’ ” Why? Well, if the middle card is an ace, then when I say “yes,” the left card is also an ace; if I say “no,” the right card is. If the middle card is a jack, it’s <i>irrelevant </i>whether I say “yes” or “no” randomly: <i>Both</i> the left and right cards must be aces since the middle is a jack. So, whether you’ve pointed at an ace or not, my answer to your question, “yes” or “no,” will always locate the other ace as long as the card you’re wondering about is an ace is not the one you’re pointing to.</p> <p>Pointing at any card, and asking about the identity of another, is the trapping strategy you need to adapt to figure out who <i>must </i>be either True or False in the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever. The way you translate pointing at any card into words, as part of your question, is to substitute the factual statement “Pluto is a dwarf planet” in the compound puzzle above with an assertion of <i>who</i> Random is—which, you’ll notice, is just as equally an arbitrary decision as which card to point at. Who we say Random is in the question will depend on who we decide to pose the question to. It doesn’t matter; it could be any of the three gods.</p> <p>Let’s pose the question to god A and assert that B is Random: “Does ‘da’ mean ‘yes’ if and only if you are True if and only if B is Random?” This is the equivalent of pointing at B while asking about the identity of A. In the card puzzle, <i>whether or not I answered truthfully or randomly</i>, you could depend on my “yes” or “no” response to find an ace with certainty. The same applies here. “<i>No matter whether A is True, False, or Random,</i>” says Boolos, “if you get the answer ‘da,’ C is either True or False, and if you get the answer ‘ja,’ B is either True or False!”</p> <p>Let’s suppose we got “ja,” (we have to suppose one or the other). This makes B either True or False, which is precisely what we wanted—we already know how to expose someone like this: Ask B, “Does ‘da’ mean ‘yes’ if and only if Pluto is a dwarf planet?” Since we know Pluto is in fact a dwarf planet, there are two possible responses:</p> <p>1. If B’s True, then you get the answer “da.”<br/>2. If B’s False, then you get “ja,” since the correct answer is “da,” and False always speaks falsely.</p> <p>Let’s assume we got “da,” which makes B True. Now ask True your third and final question: “Does ‘da’ mean ‘yes’ if and only if A is Random?” Given that Random must be A or C, there’s only one possible response:</p> <p>1. Since B’s True, you get ‘da,’ which means A is Random, and therefore C is False.</p> <p>To recap: Employing all of Boolos’ logic, our three questions to determine which god is True, False, and Random, go like this:</p> <p>1. To god A: “Does ‘da’ mean ‘yes’ if and only if you are True and if and only if B is Random?” (We supposed A said, “ja,” making B True or False).<br/>2. To god B: “Does “da” mean ‘yes’ if and only if Pluto is a dwarf planet?” (We supposed B said, “da,” making B True.)<br/>3. And to god B (True) again: “Does ‘da’ mean ‘yes’ if and only if A is Random?” Since B’s True, he must say “da,” which means A is Random, leaving C to be False.</p> <p><i>Solved!</i></p> <p><br/></p> <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>o what does the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever teach us? According to Boolos, it shows us how essential one of the supposed fundamental laws of logic—the law of excluded middle—seems to be. “Our ability to reason about alternative possibilities,” says Boolos, “even in everyday life, would be almost completely paralyzed were we to be denied the use of the law of excluded middle.” The law of excluded middle is simply this: Every statement is either true or false—there is no middle ground. That’s a sobering thought. But we have only to thank Smullyan, that most devilish of puzzlers, for making us ponder it with such edifying delight.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Brian Gallagher is an assistant editor at</i> Nautilus.</p>

            <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>everal years ago, my father died as he had done most things throughout his life: without preparation and without consulting anyone. He simply went to bed one night, yielded his brain to a monstrous blood clot, and was found the next morning lying amidst the sheets like his own stone monument.</p> <p>It was hard for me not to take my father’s abrupt exit as a rebuke. For years, he’d been begging me to visit him in the Czech Republic, where I’d been born and where he’d gone back to live in 1992. Each year, I delayed. I was in that part of my life when the marriage-grad-school-children-career-divorce current was sweeping me along with breath-sucking force, and a leisurely trip to the fatherland seemed as plausible as pausing the flow of time.</p> <p>Now my dad was shrugging at me from beyond— “You see, you’ve run out of time.”</p> <p>His death underscored another loss, albeit a far more subtle one: that of my native tongue. Czech was the only language I knew until the age of 2, when my family began a migration westward, from what was then Czechoslovakia through Austria, then Italy, settling eventually in Montreal, Canada. Along the way, a clutter of languages introduced themselves into my life: German in preschool, Italian-speaking friends, the francophone streets of East Montreal. Linguistic experience congealed, though, once my siblings and I started school in English. As with many immigrants, this marked the time when English became, unofficially and over the grumbling of my parents (especially my father), our family language—the time when Czech began its slow retreat from my daily life.</p> <p>Many would applaud the efficiency with which we settled into English—it’s what exemplary immigrants do. But between then and now, research has shown the depth of the relationship all of us have with our native tongues—and how traumatic it can be when that relationship is ruptured. Spurred by my father’s death, I returned to the Czech Republic hoping to reconnect to him. In doing so, I also reconnected with my native tongue, and with parts of my identity that I had long ignored.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Sedivy_BR-1" data-title="MEMORIES" data-capper="The author in the arms of her father, Ladislav Sedivy, together with her mother Vera and her older siblings, Marie and Silvester.

The incentives for adopting the culturally dominant language are undeniable. Proficiency offers clear financial rewards, resulting in wage increases of 15 percent for immigrants who achieve it relative to those who don’t, according to economist Barry Chiswick. A child, who rarely calculates the return on investment for her linguistic efforts, feels the currency of the dominant language in other ways: the approval of teachers and the acceptance of peers. I was mortally offended when my first-grade teacher asked me on the first day of school if I knew “a little English”—“I don’t know a little English,” was my indignant and heavily accented retort. “I know a <i>lot</i> of English.” In the schoolyard, I quickly learned that my Czech was seen as having little value by my friends, aside from the possibility of swearing in another language—a value I was unable to deliver, given that my parents were cursing teetotalers.</p> <p>But embracing the dominant language comes at a price. Like a household that welcomes a new child, a single mind can’t admit a new language without some impact on other languages already residing there. Languages can co-exist, but they tussle, as do siblings, over mental resources and attention. When a bilingual person tries to articulate a thought in one language, words and grammatical structures from the other language often clamor in the background, jostling for attention. The subconscious effort of suppressing this competition can slow the retrieval of words—and if the background language elbows its way to the forefront, the speaker may resort to code-switching, plunking down a word from one language into the sentence frame of another.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the weaker language is more likely to become swamped; when resources are scarce, as they are during mental exhaustion, the disadvantaged language may become nearly impossible to summon. Over time, neglecting an earlier language makes it harder and harder for it to compete for access.</p> <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>His death underscored another loss, albeit a far more subtle one: that of my native tongue.</p> </blockquote><p><span>According to a 2004 survey conducted in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, fewer than half of people belonging to Generation 1.5—immigrants who arrive before their teenage years—claimed to speak the language they were born into “very well.” A 2006 study of immigrant languages in Southern California forecast that even among Mexican Americans, the slowest group to assimilate within Southern California, new arrivals would live to hear only 5 out of every 100 of their great-grandchildren speak fluent Spanish.</span><br/></p> <p>When a childhood language decays, so does the ability to reach far back into your own private history. Language is memory’s receptacle. It has Proustian powers. Just as smells are known to trigger vivid memories of past experiences, language is so entangled with our experiences that inhabiting a specific language helps surface submerged events or interactions that are associated with it.</p><figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Sedivy_BR" data-title="" data-capper="" data-credits="Adrian Giddings/Flickr"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7502_475cc020a2dc98e1bd061ddfdf162fdc.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Adrian Giddings/Flickr</figcaption></figure> <p>Psychotherapist Jennifer Schwanberg has seen this firsthand. In a 2010 paper, she describes treating a client who’d lived through a brutal childhood in Mexico before immigrating to the United States. The woman showed little emotion when talking about events from her early life, and Schwanberg at first assumed that her client had made her peace with them. But one day, the woman began the session in Spanish. The therapist followed her lead and discovered that “moving to her first language had opened a floodgate. Memories from childhood, both traumatic and nontraumatic, were recounted with depth and vividness ... It became clear that a door to the past was available to her in her first language.”</p> <p>A first language remains uniquely intertwined with early memories, even for people who fully master another language. In her book <i>The Bilingual Mind</i>, linguist Aneta Pavlenko describes how the author Vladimir Nabokov fled the Russian revolution in 1919, arriving in the United Kingdom when he was 20. By the time he wrote his memoir <i>Conclusive Evidence</i> in 1951, he’d been writing in English for years, yet he struggled writing this particular text in his adopted language, complaining that his memory was tuned to the “musical key” of Russian. Soon after its publication, he translated the memoir into his native tongue. Working in his first language seems to have prodded his senses awake, leading him to insert new details into the Russian version: A simple anecdote about a stingy old housekeeper becomes perfumed with the scents of coffee and decay, the description of a laundry hamper acquires a creaking sound, the visual details of a celluloid swan and toy boat sprout as he writes about the tub in which he bathed as a child. Some of these details eventually made it into his revised English memoir, which he aptly titled <i>Speak, Memory</i>. Evidently, when memory speaks, it sometimes does so in a particular tongue.</p> <p>Losing your native tongue unmoors you not only from your own early life but from the entire culture that shaped you. You lose access to the books, films, stories, and songs that articulate the values and norms that you’ve absorbed. You lose the embrace of an entire community or nation for whom your family’s odd quirks are not quirks all. You lose your context. This disconnection can be devastating. A 2007 study led by Darcy Hallett found that in British Columbian native communities in which fewer than half of the members could converse in their indigenous language, young people killed themselves six times more often than in communities where the majority spoke the native language. In the Midwestern U.S., psychologist Teresa LaFromboise and her colleagues found that American-Indian adolescents who were heavily involved in activities focused on their traditional language and traditions did better at school and had fewer behavior problems than kids who were less connected to their traditional cultures—in fact, cultural connectedness buffered them against adolescent problems more than having a warm and nurturing mother. Such benefits appear to span continents: In 2011, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that aboriginal youth who spoke their traditional language were less likely to binge drink or use illegal drugs.</p> <p>Why is a heritage language so conducive to well-being? Michael Chandler, one of the authors of the suicide study, emphasizes that a sense of cultural continuity makes people resilient by providing them with a cohesive self-concept. Without that continuity, he warns, aboriginal youth, who have typically experienced plenty of turbulence, are in grave existential danger. They risk losing “the thread that tethers together their past, present, and future.”</p><p><br/></p>  <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s my siblings and I distanced ourselves from the Czech language in our youth, a space widened between us and our parents—especially my father, who never wore English with any comfort. Memories of our early family life, along with its small rituals and lessons imparted, receded into a past that drifted ever further out of reach. It was as if my parents’ life in their home country, and the values that defined that life, didn’t translate credibly into another language; it was much easier to rebel against them in English. Even the English names for our parents encouraged dissent: The Czech words we’d used—<i>Maminka</i>, <i>Tatinek</i>—so laden with esteem and affection, impossible to pronounce with contempt, had no corresponding forms. In English, the sweet but childish <i>Mommy</i> and <i>Daddy</i> are soon abandoned for <i>Mom</i> and <i>Dad</i>—words that, we discovered, lend themselves perfectly well to adolescent snark.</p> <p>I watched as my father grew more and more frustrated at his powerlessness to pass on to his children the legacy he most longed to leave: a burning religious piety, the nurturing of family ties, pleasure in the music and traditions of his region, and an abiding respect for ancestors. All of these became diluted by the steady flow of new memories narrated in English, laced with Anglophone aspiration and individualism. As we entered adulthood and dispersed all over North America into our self-reliant lives, my father gave up. He moved back home.</p> <p>For the next two decades, I lived my adult life, fully absorbed into the English-speaking universe, even adding American citizenship to my Canadian one. My dad was the only person with whom I regularly spoke Czech—if phone calls every few months can be described as “regularly,” and if my clumsy sentences patched together with abundant English can be called “speaking Czech.” My Czech heritage began to feel more and more like a vestigial organ.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>You lose the embrace of an entire community. You lose your context.</p> </blockquote><p><span>Then my father died. Loss inevitably reveals that which is gone. It was as if the string section of the orchestra had fallen silent—not carrying the melody, it had gone unnoticed, but its absence announced how much depth and texture it had supplied, how its rhythms had lent coherence to the music. In grieving my father, I became aware of how much I also mourned the silencing of Czech in my life. There was a part of me, I realized, that only Czech could speak to, a way of being that was hard to settle into, even with my own siblings and mother when we spoke in English.</span><br/></p> <p>After my father’s death, my siblings and I inherited a sweet little apartment in a large compound that has been occupied by the Sedivy family since the 1600s, and where my uncle still lives with his sprawling family. This past spring, I finally cleared two months of my schedule and went for a long visit, sleeping on the very same bed where my father and his brothers had been born.</p> <p>I discovered that, while I may have run out of time to visit my father in his homeland, there was still time for me to reunite with my native tongue. On my first day there, the long drive with my uncle between the airport and our place in the countryside was accompanied by a conversation that lurched along awkwardly, filled with dead ends and misunderstandings. Over the next few days, I had trouble excavating everyday words like <i>stamp</i> and <i>fork</i>, and I made grammar mistakes that would (and did) cause a 4-year-old to snicker. But within weeks, fluency began to unspool. Words that I’m sure I hadn’t used in decades leapt out of my mouth, astounding me. (Often they were correct. Sometimes not: I startled a man who asked about my occupation by claiming to be a savior—<i>spasitelka</i>. Sadly, I am a mere writer—<i>spisovatelka</i>.) The complicated inflections of Czech, described as “character-building” by an acquaintance who’d learned the language in college, began to assemble into somewhat orderly rows in my mind, and I quickly ventured onto more and more adventurous grammatical terrain. Just a few weeks into my visit, I briefly passed as a real Czech speaker in a conversation with a stranger. Relearning Czech so quickly felt like having linguistic superpowers.</p> <p>Surprised by the speed of my progress, I began to look for studies of heritage speakers relearning childhood languages that had fallen into disuse. A number of scientific papers reported evidence of cognitive remnants of “forgotten” languages, remnants that were visible mostly in the process of relearning. In some cases, even when initial testing hinted at language decay, people who’d been exposed to the language earlier in life showed accelerated relearning of grammar, vocabulary, and most of all, of control over the sounds of the language.</p> <p>One of the most remarkable examples involved a group of Indian adoptees who’d been raised from a young age (starting between 6 and 60 months) in English-speaking families, having no significant contact with their language of origin. The psychologist Leher Singh tested the children when they were between the ages of 8 and 16. Initially, neither group could hear the difference between dental and retroflex consonants, a distinction that’s exploited by many Indian languages. After listening to the contrasting sounds over a period of mere minutes, the adoptees, but not the American-born children, were able to discriminate between the two classes of consonants.</p> <p>This is revealing because a language’s phonology, or sound structure, is one of the greatest challenges for people who start learning a language in adulthood. Long after they’ve mastered its syntax and vocabulary, a lifelong accent may mark them as latecomers to the language. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the star of many American movies and the governor of the country’s biggest state, but his Austrian accent is a constant reminder that he could never run for president. The crucial timing of exposure for native-like speech is evident in my own family: I can pronounce the notoriously difficult “ř” sound in Czech—as in the name of the composer Dvořák—but my brother, born three years after me, in Vienna, cannot.</p> <p>Phonology’s resistance to both attrition and later learning may be due to the fact that the sound structure of a language is fixed in a child’s mind very early. Before 6 months of age, infants can distinguish most subtle differences in speech sounds, whether their language makes use of those distinctions or not. But over the second half of their first year, they gradually tune their perception to just the sounds of the language they hear around them. Children who hear only English lose the ability to distinguish between dental and retroflex sounds. Children learning Japanese begin to hear “r” and “l” as variants of the same sound. Linguist Pat Kuhl, who has studied this phenomenon for decades, describes the process as one of perceptual narrowing and increasing neural commitment, eventually excluding native-like perception of other languages.</p> <p>One of the most striking examples of the brain’s attunement to native sounds is apparent in languages such as Mandarin, where varying the tone of an utterance can produce entirely different words. (For instance, the syllable <i>ma</i> can mean “mother,” “hemp,” “horse,” or “scold,” depending on the pitch contour you lay over it.) When Mandarin speakers hear nonsense syllables that are identical except for their tones, they show heightened activity in the left hemisphere of the brain, where people normally process sounds that signal differences in meaning—like the difference between the syllables “pa” and “ba.” But speakers of non-tonal languages like English have more activity in the <i>right</i> hemisphere, showing that the brain doesn’t treat tone as relevant for distinguishing words. A recent study found that Chinese-born babies adopted into French homes showed brain activity that matched Chinese speakers and was clearly distinct from monolingual French speakers—even after being separated from their birth language for more than 12 years.</p> <figure class="breaker-image" data-alt="Sedivy_BR-art" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7480_62ac9cd1eac1b6b1d204d458ee016173.png" alt=""/></figure> <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he brain’s devotion to a childhood language reminds me of a poem by Emily Dickinson:</p><p><br/></p> <p>The Soul selects her own Society—<br/> Then—shuts the Door—<br/> To her divine Majority—<br/> Present no more—</p> <p>Unmoved—she notes the Chariots—pausing—<br/> At her low Gate—<br/> Unmoved—an Emperor be kneeling<br/> Upon her Mat—</p> <p>I’ve known her—from an ample nation—<br/> Choose One—<br/> Then—close the Valves of her attention—<br/> Like Stone—</p> <p>Those of us who received more than one language before the valves of our attention closed may find, to our surprise, that our earliest language lingers on in our soul’s select society, long after we thought it had faded.</p> <p>I’ve become aware of the deep sense in which I belong to the Czech language, as well as the extent to which my formative memories are tinged by its “musical key.” For me, the English phrase “pork with cabbage and dumplings” refers to a concept, the national dish of the Czechs. But hearing the Czech phrase <i>vepřo-knedlo-zelo</i> evokes the fragrance of roasting meat, pillowy dumpling loaves being pulled steaming out of a tall pot and sliced with sewing thread, and the clink of the nice china as the table is dressed for Sunday dinner, the fulcrum of every week.</p> <p>Since coming back from the Czech Republic, I’ve insisted on speaking Czech with my mother. Even though it’s more effortful for both of us than speaking in English, our conversation feels softer, more tender this way. English was the language in which I forged my independence, the language of my individuation—but it was in Czech that I was nurtured, comforted, and sung to.</p> <p>It has also gotten easier to hear the timbre of my father’s voice in my mind’s ear, especially when working in my garden. It’s no accident that many of my conversations with him, and more recently with my uncle, have been on the subject of horticulture. My father’s family has lived for centuries in the fertile wine and orchard region of Moravia, and on my recent visit, I saw my relatives gaze out at their land with an expression usually reserved for a beloved spouse or child. Throughout my own life, I’ve given in to the compulsion to fasten myself to whatever patch of land I happened to be living on by growing things on it, an impulse that has often conflicted with the upwardly and physically mobile trajectory of my life. It’s an impulse I submit to once again, living now in the lee of the Rocky Mountains; neither grapes nor apricots will thrive in the brittle mountain air, but I raise sour cherries and saskatoons, small fruits native to western Canada. As I mulch and weed and prune, I sometimes find myself murmuring to my plants in Czech as my father did, and the Moravian homestead doesn’t seem very far away.</p> <p>My newly vocal native tongue, and along with it, the heightened memory of my father’s voice, does more than connect me to my past: It is proving to be an unexpected guide in my present work. I’ve recently left my job as an academic linguist to devote more time to writing, and I often find myself these days conjuring my father’s voice by reading a passage in Czech. Like many Czechs I’ve met, my father treated his language like a lovely object to be turned over, admired, stroked with a fingertip, deserving of deliberate and leisurely attention. He spoke less often than most people, but was more often eloquent. I may never regain enough of my first language to write anything in it worth reading, but when I struggle to write prose that not only informs but transcends, I find myself steering my inner monologue toward Czech. It reminds me of what it feels like to sink into language, to be startled by the aptness of a word or the twist of a phrase, to be delighted by arrangements of its sounds, and lulled by its rhythms. I’ve discovered that my native language has been sitting quietly in my soul’s vault all this time.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><i>Julie Sedivy has taught linguistics and psychology at Brown University and the University of Calgary.
